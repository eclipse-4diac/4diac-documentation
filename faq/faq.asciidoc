[[4diacfaq1]]
=== When I open a certain perspective, a view element is missing, how can I get it back?
+
There are two possibilities to do that:
* Reset Perspective: When right-clicking on the active perspective's
name in the perspective switcher, you get a context menu with the option
Reset. By selecting this item, the perspective is reset to the initial
configuration showing all views again and at their original place.
* Show View Menu: The menu item [.menu4diac]#Window → Show View → Other#
brings up a selection dialog that allows you to open any view. By
searching through the items you can reopen an accidentally closed view.
This option is especially of interest when you have a custom perspective
layout you don't like to lose by resetting the perspective.

=== Download not possible! Defined profile () for RMT_XXX.xxx not supported
* Go to the System Configuration
* Select the Device which is named in the error message
* Change the properties [.menu4diac]#Dialog → Advanced → Misc → Profile#
* Set Profile to HOLOBLOC

=== When I download my application, I get an [.errorMessage]#UNSUPPORTED TYPE# error message in the [.view4diac]#Deployment Console#
+
This message appears for multiple problems:
* Make sure that you have the source code (*.cpp, *.h) of all
[.element4diac]#Function Blocks# within your
[.element4diac]#Application#. Also check if all source files are listed
within a [.fileLocation]#CMakeLists.txt# file.
* Ensure that the missing Function Block is included in your built
version of 4diac FORTE.
** In 4diac IDE [.menu4diac]#Window → Preferences → 4diac IDE → FORTE
Preferences# the path to your correct [.fileLocation]#forte.exe# has to
be defined.
** Or start your [.fileLocation]#forte.exe# directly (development tool
specific)

=== When I download my application, I get a [.errorMessage]#STATUS ACCESS VIOLATION# error messages in the [.view4diac]#Deployment Console#
+
Check if you used [.element4diac]#Composite Function Blocks# within your
[.element4diac]#Application#. Make sure that you have the source code
(*.cpp, *.h) of all [.element4diac]#Function Blocks# within the
[.element4diac]#Composite's Network#. Also check if all source files are
listed within a [.fileLocation]#CMakeLists.txt# file.

=== When I download my application, I get a [.errorMessage]#Create FB Instance failed# error
+
Verify that the interface of the Function Block you want to download is
the same as those available on your 4diac FORTE executable. In case you
download a Composite Function Block, please make sure that its Function
Block Network matches the Function Block Network within your 4diac FORTE
executable. When in doubt, export your Function Block and compile
4diac FORTE before you download again.

=== When I want to download my application, I get a [.errorMessage]#connection refused# message
+
Examine the following topics:
* Make sure that the port numbers used in the [.view4diac]#Runtime
Launcher# of the [.view4diac]#Deployment# view are the same as those
used for the [.element4diac]#MGR_ID# of the [.element4diac]#Devices# in
the [.view4diac]#System Configuration#.
* Check if 4diac FORTE runs on a different port
* Check in Task Manager (Windows) if an "old" crashed 4diac FORTE blocks
the port
* Check if Monitoring has been started before downloading (FORTE only
supports a single connection at the management interface)

=== How do I use ARRAYs?
+
When you create a new Function Block, choose the desired type for your
array elements in the [.menu4diac]#Type# drop down of the specific data
and set the desired array size [.menu4diac]#ArraySize#. For
initializing, put the values in curly brackets (e.g.,
[.inlineCode]#\{1,2,3}#).

=== What does [.command4diac]#CLEAN Device# do?
+
[.command4diac]#CLEAN Device# deletes all existing
[.element4diac]#Resources# and the FBs in the
[.element4diac]#Resources#. After [.command4diac]#CLEAN Device#, you can
deploy any other FB Network.

=== What does [.command4diac]#KILL Device# do?

[.command4diac]#KILL Devices# terminates 4diac FORTE.

=== Windows/Cygwin: The setup script runs to completion but when building the target, I get strange compile errors
* First, check for any strange output of the setup script. Maybe your
system misses something.
* Do you have spaces in the path to your 4diac FORTE? Some Cygwin
versions have problems with these.

=== CMake/Cygwin: Can not find C and C++ compilers
+
CMake Errors:
+
your C compiler: CMAKE_C_COMPILER-NOTFOUND was not found. Please set
CMAKE_C_COMPILER to a valid compiler path or name. your CXX compiler:
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER-NOTFOUND was not found. Please set CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
to a valid compiler path or name.
+
In this case, you need to tick the check box Advanced and look for
[.specificText]#CMAKE_CXXX_COMPILER# and
[.specificText]#CMAKE_C_COMPILER# and set the path and executable for
your C and C++ compiler. As an example, for Cygwin this could be
[.fileLocation]#c:\cygwin\bin\g++-3.exe# for the C++ compiler and
[.fileLocation]#c:\cygwin\bin\gcc-3.exe# for the C compiler.

=== CMake/Cygwin: Can not find RC Compilers
+
CMake Error:
+
your RC compiler: CMAKE_RC_COMPILER-NOTFOUND was not found. Please set
CMAKE_RC_COMPILER to a valid compiler path or name.
+
Again you need to tick the check box Advanced and look for
[.specificText]#CMAKE_RC_COMPILER#. For Cygwin or MinGW on Windows, it
needs a file called windres.exe (e.g., C:\cygwin\bin\windres.exe).

=== FORTE is C++, why are you then using the C-style include files for the standard c library instead of the C++ style include files?
+
The main reason for this is that not all platforms provide the correct
C++ include files. This especially applies to real-time OS such as eCos
where you can freely configure the supported features. Using C++ style C
include files on these platforms would pull lots of stuff from the
compilers in and result in a bigger image or even worse it would not
compile. So as to current experience, C style include files are more
reliable.

=== Within my 4diac FORTE console, I get [.errorMessage]#UDP-Socket Send failed: Network is unreachable#
+
Consider to explicitly set up multicast IP routing in the kernel with
the [.inlineCode]#route# command. This has been an issue on Raspberry
Pi, where executing the following command resolved the problem:
+
route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0
+
The IPs are the desired multicast IPs.

=== Within my 4diac FORTE console, I get [.errorMessage]#connection closed by peer#
+
The TCP port is opened by a server in the RMT_RES. This server handles
the communication with the tool for download and monitoring. The message
indicates the end of the download process when 4diac IDE disconnects.
