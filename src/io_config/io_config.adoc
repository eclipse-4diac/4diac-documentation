= I/O Configuration for Different Platforms
:lang: en

Using QX, IX and similar allows you to access the inputs and outputs of a supported hardware. 
Of course, in the case of a normal computer, this doesn't apply since it doesn't have I/O that you can control directly like you do on a PLC (normally boolean). 
Currently there are two I/O integration concepts, the parameter based and the _IO_CONFIG_ based one.

== Parameter Based I/Os

The parameter based I/O support uses the PARAMS data input of the IX, QX, ... function blocks.
In order to access the I/O of a hardware, you need to set the PARAMS data input to a corresponding value to select which I/O to access. 
4diac FORTE should be compiled with the corresponding module, that can be selected in CMake. 
You find here the values to be set to PARAMS for the following supported platforms:

. xref:./EV3.adoc[Lego Mindstorms EV3]

== IO_CONFIG Based I/Os

The _IO_CONFIG_ based I/O support uses an IEC 61499 Resource, that could be called _IO_CONFIG_RES_, but the naming is up to you. 
This IEC 61499 Resource contains a function block or a function block network that represents your hardware.
If it is only one function block or a network of function blocks, depends on your hardware. 
Modular PLCs for example are represented as function block network, where one module represents the core module and the others the expansion modules.
The function blocks for the supported hardware modules are within the _io_ folder of the type library.
Any I/O of a hardware module is represented by a function block input of type STRING or WSTRING.
The STRING or WSTRING inputs are then set to the hierarchical name of an IX, QX, ... function block instance you used within your application.
Each hierarchy level is separated by a dot '.'. 
The hierarchy starts with the name of the IEC 61499 Application, followed by the dot, possible IEC 61499 sub-application names or composite function block names, also separated by dots and at last the instance name of the IX, QX, ... function block.
This concept of I/O support let your IEC 61499 Application be completely hardware independent.
For the supported platforms have a look on the following chapters:
