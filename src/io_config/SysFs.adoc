The following picture shows an example application from the xref:../tutorials/use4diacLocally.adoc[Blinking tutorial] which is extended with IX and QX function blocks. 
The extended application periodically toggles on pin number 8. 
It can be started and stopped via pin number 2. 
You can connect an LED to obtain a blinking light.

The `PARAMS` data input in the IX and QX FB define which pin should be used. 
The application also contains E_CYCLE and E_SWITCH function blocks (which are not in the Blinking tutorial). 
The first one generates an event every 500 ms. 
This way the IX block will check the hardware input every half second if the signal has changed. 
E_SWITCH_0 starts or stops the action, depending on the `IN` data output of the IX function block.

Remember that if you have any problem and cannot find the solution in the documentation, visit the https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=thread&frm_id=308[forum].
