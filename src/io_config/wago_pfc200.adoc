Wago PFC200 series is a PLC designed to work in small and medium enterprises for small-scale automation and runs on an ARM cortex A8, 600 Mhz controller with real-time Linux 3.6 (RT preemption patch). 

== Currently supported Wago modules

- *WagoMaster*: Wago core module PFC 200
- *Wago1405_6*: 16 digital inputs, Wago module 750-1405 and 750-1406
- *Wago1504_5*: 16 digital outputs, Wago module 750-1504 (positive switching) and 750-1505 (negative switching)
- *Wago1506*: 8 digital IOs, Wago module 750-1506 
- *Wago459*: 4 Analog inputs, Wago module 750-459
- *Wago636*: DC-Drive-Controller 24V 5A, Wago module 750-636 


== Setup your hardware

Put the several modules together by the rails on each Wago module and as last module the end module 750-600 otherwise the KBus cannot be initialized correctly.
The core module provides the power supply for all modules connect all 0V and 24V of your core module with your 24V power supply.
In case you use an analog input module 750-459 consider that each analog input has a corresponding 0V connection that also has to be connected.
When you use the Wago core module for the first time, it will startup with CODESYS.
According to the https://github.com/WAGO/pfc-howtos/tree/master/HowTo_ADI-MyKBusApplikation[Wago GitHub How To]:

[IMPORTANT]
====
"_The ADI/DAL could only be used by one master, it could be the CODESYS-Runtime or your own application, but not both_". This means you have to stop the CODESYS-Runtime when you want to use 4diac FORTE. Login to your PFC200 to stop the CODESYS-Runtime with one of the following methods:

For temporary stop:

	>/etc/init.d/runtime stop

for permanent stop:

	#//Delete symbolic link
	>rm /etc/rc.d/S98_runtime
	#Recover symbolic link
	>ln -s /etc/init.d/runtime /etc/rc.d/S98_runtime

A general explanation about how the process image of Wago modules is created, can be found within the PDF https://github.com/WAGO/pfc-howtos/blob/master/HowTo_ADI-MyKBusApplikation/a800010_en%20-%20ADI-DAL%20for%20PFC%20firmware%2011%20patch%202.pdf[ADI/DAL PFC Firmware] provided by Wago. This document is useful especially when integrating new Wago modules or other modules that use the KBus. This document states the following important information:

[IMPORTANT]
====
"_Every I/O-Module offers some fixed sized process data values and configuration information. Process data size varies from 2 bit up to 24 bytes. Process data values also have a direction, named “input process data” or “output process data”. Also IO-Modules are classified as “digital” or “complex”. Configuration of IO-Modules is stored inside “registers”, accessible via “register-communication” or “parameter-channel”. Every WAGO Output-Module monitors elapsed time since the last kbus-cycle. If the elapsed time exceeds 50ms, Output-Modules shut down their outputs to a failsafe state._" 

"_With adi->OpenDevice the device driver identifies all connected IO-Modules and constructs two process images: Process-Image-of-Inputs (PII) and Process-Image-of-Outputs (PIO)_"
====

Consider that each Wago module has its own manual, which describes the bits of its process image in detail.

== Compile 4diac for PFC200

To compile 4diac FORTE for Wago PFC200 best use https://github.com/eclipse-4diac/4diac-fbe[4diac FORTE's build environment].
Since Wago PFC200 has dependencies you have to add a new recipe containing information for these dependencies.
Under _fordiac-fbe/dependencies/recipes/_ create a folder called _wago_ and add the following files and file contents:
	
- the file _build.cmake_ with the following content:

	project(wago C)
	CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED(VERSION 3.5)
	install(DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/. DESTINATION include)
	install(DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/OsLinux/. DESTINATION include)
	install(DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/. DESTINATION lib)
	
- the file _wago.7z_ with your dependencies, which you might find in the sdk-builder container created according to https://github.com/WAGO/pfc-firmware-sdk-G2[pfc-firmware-sdk-G2]:

- the file _package.txt_ with the following content. You should determine the ssh256 for your _wago.7z_ file and add it instead of the example shown here:

	wago.7z -H sha256:75bd3904f6b68ba937dbf1d59de44fd07ded7892c9c8c4e8bf86a439ab180613 -X build.cmake	

After this preparation follow the instructions of 4diac FORTE's build environment to install and setup a configuration.
Your configuration file for Wago PFC200 for this build environment could be like the following:

----
ARCH=arm-linux-gnueabihf

DEPS=tinyxml
DEPS=wago

COM=ETH,FBDK,LOCAL,HTTP

MODULE=CONVERT,IEC61131,UTILS,UTILS_ADDON,CUSTOM_FBS
MODULE=WagoKbus

// address sanitizer doesn't work with static linking
TOOLCHAIN_EXTRA_C_FLAGS=-fno-sanitize=address -fno-lto
TOOLCHAIN_EXTRA_LINKER_FLAGS=-fno-sanitize=address -fno-lto

FORTE_IO=ON

// no local additions
#FORTE_EXTERNAL_MODULES_DIRECTORY=/nonexistant
----

After successful compilation the runtime can be found within the folder _build/yourConfigurationFileName/output/bin_ of 4diac FORTE's build environment.
Copy the whole content to your Wago PFC200 core module by e.g. https://winscp.net/eng/index.php[WinSCP], possibly within a folder _/home/forte_.
You should set execution rights for for all copied files to run it.
Login to your Wago PFC200 core module by e.g. https://putty.org/[Putty], navigate to the folder where you put your executable and run it by _./forte_.
Now you can deploy the desired IEC 61499 resources on your Wago PFC200.

== Configure your hardware in 4diac

Within 4diac IDE create a new IEC 61499 device with one IEC 61499 resource. 
Maybe call it _IO_CONFIG_RES_.
This _IO_CONFIG_RES_ contains your hardware setup in terms of function blocks.
In case you have one Wago PFC200 core module, two DI, two DO, and one AIO module, it could be like in the following image.

image:wago_ioconfig.png[IO_CONFIG function block network]

Within your IEC 61499 application you might have a function block like shown within the following image.
Take it's IEC 61499 application name and it's instance name separated by a dot and add it as input for the desired input of the corresponding _IO_CONFIG_ function block.

image:revpi_ioFb.png[I/O function block in your IEC 61499 application]

When all I/Os are wired and named within your _IO_CONFIG_ function block network correspondingly, your IEC 61499 application is ready to be deployed and to access the hardware.
