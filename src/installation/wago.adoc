== Introduction

Wago PFC 200 series is a PLC designed to work in small and medium enterprises for small-scale automation and runs on an ARM cortex A8, 600 Mhz controller with real-time Linux 3.6 (RT preemption patch). 
This tutorial helps setting up 4diac FORTE on the WAGO embedded platform. 
The essentials for following this tutorial are:

* http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Downloads[Ubuntu 14.04 LTS] host system with minimum 25 GB Hard Disk space (e.g. as a https:// www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] VM)
* Within Ubuntu, download :
** https://www.wago.com/public-download/support/BSP/WAGO-PFC-BSP-latest.zip[WAGO-PFC-BSP] Board Support Package (BSP) for configuring and building customized applications on Wago PFCs.
** Dependencies for Wago BSP
*** http://debian.pengutronix.de/debian[OSELAS cross tool chain 2012.12.1] for Crotex A8 boards
*** http://www.ptxdist.org/software/ptxdist/download/[PTXDist-2013.03.0] a GPL-licensed build system for building target embedded Linux kernel and root system from sources.
** http://www.eclipse.org/4diac/en_dow.php[Latest version of 4diac FORTE source] which contains the [.specicificText]#processInterface# for Wago at `forte/src/modules/wagokbus`. 
  The `processInterface` facilitates using Wago analog and digital IOs with generic IX,QX and IW,QW blocks from 4diac IDE.


IMPORTANT: This tutorial is based on WAGO-PFC-BSP-2014.10.3. 
The procedure given here is also applicable for the latest board support packages from Wago. 
The toolchain and the PTXDist version may also vary based on the BSP version.

== Wago BSP Installation on Ubuntu Host

DO NOT install the packages within the root folder! 
The installation may take over an hour, therefore, be patient till the whole process is complete.

. Create a folder e.g. `~/Wago`
. Unzip the board support Package for WAGO PFC downloaded before into the `~/Wago` folder. 
  Follow the installation process as found in HOWTo_Install_WAGO_PFC_BSP-version till the step [.specificText]#Compile all packages of PFC200 Firmware#.

=== Building 4diac FORTE

4diac FORTE is normally deployed in cross platforms using CMake. 
Here, for the wago device, all the build process is controlled by [.specicificText]#ptxdist#. 
For the 4diac FORTE build process it is important to know about a few directories in the wago development environment. 
All ptxdist packages are managed by so-called rule files. 
These files are located in the `wago/ptxproj-2.2.20/rules` directory. 
When you create  a new package, rule files `packagename.make` and `packagename.in` are created in the rules directory.
There are two kinds of source directories, `wago/src` for system level packages and `wago/local_src` for new custom packages. 
The build directory for the target system (i.e., wago) is located in a directory called `platformwago-wago-pfc200/build-target`.

. Create a forte_wago project in PTXDist: From `FORTE/buildsupport/wago_pfc200/`, copy the rule files `forte_wago.in` and `forte_wago.make` to `wago/ptxproj-2.2.20/rules` (creates a new package).
  Within the copied rule file `../ptxproj-2.2.20/forte_wago.make` edit the line `FORTE_WAGO_URL: file:///<path to 4diac FORTE main directory>` to the absolute path of your 4diac FORTE main directory. 
  To(de)activate specific modules (library parts) of 4diac FORTE edit `.../ptxproj-2.2.20/wago.make` line `FORTE_WAGO_CONF_OPT := ...`
. Save the package to PTXDist: 
  To follow the standard build process of PTXDist the package has to be saved to the PTXDist build environment.
  Select the `forte_wago` with space key (This will be displayed as `[*]`) and press exit to quit. 
  When asked whether you want to save the package, press [.button4diac]#Yes#.
+
IMPORTANT: PTXDist is a command line utility which works only from the defined project environment, for example IMPORTANT: ~wago/ptxproj-2.2.20IMPORTANT:  directory. 
The `ptxdist` commands will work only in this directory.
+
----
> cd wago/ptxproj-2.2.20 > ptxdist menuconfig
----
+
image:wagoManager.png[PTXDist Manager]
. Build the project: Go to your `ptxproj-2.2.20` folder and perform the build instruction as follows to build 4diac FORTE for the target device Wago PFC.
+
----
> cd wago/ptxproj-2.2.20 > ptxdist targetinstall forte_wago
----
+
image:wagoConsole.png[Build Project Console Output]
+
The binary can be found in the directory `.../ptxproj-2.2.20/platform-wago-pfc200/buid-target/forte_wago-1.6.2-build/src`.
The binary can be either copied to the target device `/usr/bin` directory or you can build your own custom linux image by performing `<ptxdist go>;` command in your `ptxproj-2.2.20` directory and boot with your own custom firmware.
. Rebuilding the Project: For rebuilding the project, the project has to be cleaned and perform the `targetinstall` again.
+
----
> cd wago/ptxproj-2.2.20 > ptxdist clean forte_wago
----
+
This clean instruction deletes the `forte_wago` build time stamps in the wago development environment. 
Now performing a `targetinstall` will rebuild the project
+
----
> ptxdist targetinstall forte_wago
----
+
If you made any changes in your 4diac FORTE root folder this changes will be reflected here and you will see the same window as you saw before.

== Building and Debugging 4diac FORTE remotely on Wago PFC with Eclipse

=== Building 4diac FORTE with Eclipse

4diac FORTE can be debugged remotely from your Ubuntu host machine using Eclipse CDT. 
For more details, please refer to Wago on how to Utilize EclipseCDT. 
Using the same procedure, 4diac FORTE can be debugged remotely. 
The recommended folder structure for building 4diac FORTE in Eclipse is:

* eclipseCDT
** workspace
*** forte (contains 4diac FORTE source)
*** forte-wago (contains project to access the Wago PFC)

Within the forte-wago folder, create a new `C Project` by [.menu4diac]#Menu → File → New → Project#, type a project name, e.g., `forte-wago`, deactivate default location and set the location to your 4diac FORTE source e.g., `forte`. 
Choose [.menu4diac]#Makefile project/Empty Makefile Project# and [.menu4diac]#- Other Toolchain -# and press [.button4diac]#Finish#. 
Set the properties for the new projects. 
Within the category [.menu4diac]#C/C++ Build# set the `Build command` to ptxdist and the `Build directory` to your ptxdist installation
location.
