This instruction assumes you have a Linux system with a PikeOS 5.x installation and a CODOE installation matching to the installed PikeOS
Version. +
(CODEO is the Eclipse-based IDE for developing PikeOS projects shipped with the PikeOS product.) 
Also CMAKE and CMAKE-GUI are installed.

Assuming you are familiar with PikeOS basics explained in the "pikeos-tutorial.pdf".

Assuming you have a CODEO workspace with 4 projects:

* */home/user/workspace* + CODEO workspace
** *üóÅ pool* 
+ 
"CUSTOM POOL" for all PikeOS Projects
** *üóÅ forte-incubation* 
+
4diac¬†FORTE source code 
+
Imported project using CODEOs (Eclipse) import wizard (`File ‚Üí Import ‚Üí General ‚Üí Projects from Folder or Archive`). 
After importing the project was renamed to "forte-incubation". 
+
The import source may be a cloned git repository (`git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/4diac/org.eclipse.4diac.forte.git`) or the ZIP-File "4diac¬†FORTE Source" downloaded from https://eclipse.dev/4diac/en_dow.php[eclipse.org/4diac].
** *üóÅ lwip.app* 
+
PikeOS 5.x Application Project of type _Posix Project / lwip-build_.
** *üóÅ forteserver.int* 
+
PikeOS 5.x Integration Project of type _Integration Project / devel-posix_.

== Patching "lwip.app"

The `lwip.app` application project will build a library (`iblwip.a`) that is required by 4diac¬†FORTE. 
So we will _abuse_ this project to build 4diac¬†FORTE (binary name: `forte`) together with `iblwip.a`. 

Apply patch `forte-incubation/src/arch/pikeos_posix/lwip.patch` to the `lwip.app`. 

This will adapt the Makefile and the `lwip.app/lwipopts.h` file as required for building 4diac¬†FORTE. 
Patching `lwip.app/lwipopts.h` enables multicast which 4diac¬†FORTE uses when multiple instances are communicating with each other. 
In addition, a folder `lwip.app/4diac-forte`. 
This folder will be used by the `forte-incubation` project to store the required source and Make-files into for building the `forte` binary.

== Running CMAKE for "forte-incubation"

The "PikeOS Posix" target of the `forte-incubation` project needs the environment variables exported by `lwip.app/PikeOS.sh`.

Open a shell (e.g. on selecting `lwip.app` in CODEO and pushing [.kbd] ‚áß + [.kbd] Alt + [.kbd] W and selecting _Terminal_) and
execute:
----
`console source /home/user/workspace/lwip.app/PikeOS.sh cd ../forte-incubation cmake-gui`
----
Alternatively, you can:
 
. Right-click on "forte-incubation" project and select "Properties". 
. Select "C/C++-Build" and click on "Manage Configurations..."
. Rename "RELEASE" to "CMAKE", remove all other existing configurations and press the "OK" button.
. Uncheck "Use default build command" and set it to:
+
----
bash -c "source $\{workspace_loc:/lwip.app/PikeOS.sh}; cd $\{workspace_loc:/forte-incubation}; cmake-gui
----
+
. Uncheck "Generate Makefiles automatically" and set "Build directory" to:
+
----
$\{workspace_loc:/forte-incubation}/
----
+
. Now you can run CMAKE-GUI by right-click on "forte-incubation" project and selecting "Build Project"

CMAKE-GUI shows a dialog. 
First set `forte-incubation` as source folder and `lwip.app` binary folder:

image:set_src_bin.svg[source code:
/home/user/workspace/forte-incubation, binaries:
/home/user/workspace/lwip.app/4diac-forte,title="Setting path to src and bin"]


Push _Configure_ and select "Unix Makefiles" and "Specify options for cross-compiling":

image:set_crossc.svg[Unix Makefiles cross-compiling options,title="Setting cross-compiling"]

Push _Next_, set "Operating System" to "Generic" and leave all other fields blank.

image:set_os.svg[OS:Generic,title="Setting OS"]

After that press _Finish_ which will occur an expected error dialog. 
Close the dialog and set parameter `FORTE_ARCHITECTURE` to `PikeOS_Posix`.

image:set_forte_arch.svg[FORTE<em>ARCHITECTURE=PikeOS</em>Posix,title="Setting FORTE_ARCHITECTURE"]

Push _Configure_ twice. 
Now no error should be present any more.
This means that no parameter is highlighted with light-red color any more.


== Building "forte" binary for PikeOS

In the `lwip.app` project Make-target "all" will build `lwip.a` together with the `forte` binary. Make-target "install" additionally will copy `forte` to `$PIKEOS_CUSTOM_POOL_DIR/posix`.

== PikeOS Integration Project "forteserver.int"

Select `posix-devel/Application/Posix Process` and change `Host file` to `CUSTOM_POOL/posix/forte`. 
Now click the _Add..._ button (under the _Project Structure_ heading), add template `posix / lwIP Ethernet interface` to `Posix Process` and configure it:

| Key |Value |Example for QEMU with Usermode NW |Example for QEMU with TUN/TAP NW 

|Interface Address | e.g. MUXA Target IP +1 | 10.0.2.16 | 192.168.0.3 
|Netmask | 255.x.x.x | 255.255.255.0 | 255.255.255.0  
|Gateway address | Gateway in target NW to reach the host | 10.0.2.2 | 192.168.0.1

The Project looks like this:

* posix-devel
** ‚ñ¢ Application
*** ‚óò POSIX Partition
*** ‚óô POSIX Process
*** ... lwIP Ethernet ...
** ‚ñ¢ Default
** ‚ñ¢ Development Tools
** ‚ñ¢ qemu-...

Assuming we use QEMU with user mode network. 
This will let 4diac¬†FORTE run on `10.0.2.16:61499` as `61499` is 4diac¬†FORTE's default port.

NOTE: If you want to use a different port you have to add template `posix / Environment variables` to `Posix Process` (similar behavior like adding `posix / lwIP Ethernet interface`).
Parameter `-c IP:PORT` will start 4diac¬†FORTE on an other port.

Right-click on `POSIX Partition` and click "copy". 
Right-click on `Application` and click on `insert`. 
Rename "partition name" and "partition id" eg. to "posix2" and "3" as they have to be unique. 

Repeat this procedure for `POSIX Process`. 

* Click on `POSIX Partition (2)` and assign process `POSIX Process (2)`. 
* Click on `POSIX Process (2) / ... lwIP Ethernet ...` and change `DEPEND: LW__IP__DEVICE_IF` to `...-vchan2`. 
* Configure `POSIX Process (2) / ... lwIP Ethernet ...`:

Now the project looks like this:

* posix-devel
** ‚ñ¢ Application
*** ‚óò POSIX Partition
*** ‚óô POSIX Process
*** ‚óò POSIX Partition (2)
*** ‚óô POSIX Process (2)
** ‚ñ¢ Default

**** ‚ñ¢ ...-net-device
**** ‚ñ¢ ...-net-vchan0
**** ‚ñ¢ ...-net-vchan1
**** ‚ñ¢ ...-net-vchan2
**** ‚ñ¢ ...-net-vchan3

Open `Development Tools / muxa / channels` and delete the assignment of "POSIX Process (2)". Rename channel 4 to e.g. "posix2-stdio".
Assign "POSIX Process (2)" to this channel.

Go to `qemu-... / ... Ethernet User Level Driver` and set "Enable Multicast Communication" to true for `...-net-device`, `...-net-vchan0` and `...-net-vchan1`.

Now you are able to test the partitions by starting QEMU and perform the xref:../tutorials/overview.adoc[4DIAC-step-by-step tutorial].

On using user mode network you have to start QEMU by selecting "Start QEMU with custom commandline" and defining portforwarding:
----
-net user,hostfwd=udp::21500-:1500,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:61499-10.0.2.16:61499,hostfwd=tcp 127.0.0.1:61500-10.0.2.17:61499,host=10.0.2.2,net=10.0.2.0/255.255.255.0
----

"Start QEMU with custom commandline" does not overwrite "muxa.xml"s Target IP and port as it would be by selecting "Start QEMU with user mode network". 
This Make-target stub allows to adapt the generated "muxa.xml" to user mode networking:

----
make boot: all     
	$(eval HOSTIP := 127.0.0.1)
	$(eval TARGETPORT := 21500)
	@sed -ie "s/^.*TargetIP.*$$/    <Parameter Name=\"TargetIP\" Value=\"$(HOSTIP)\"\/>/" muxa.xml     
	@sed -ie "s/^.*HostIP.*$$/    <Parameter Name=\"HostIP\" Value=\"$(HOSTIP)\"\/>/" muxa.xml     
	@sed -ie "s/^.*TargetPort.*$$/    <Parameter Name=\"TargetPort\" Value=\"$(TARGETPORT)\"\/>/" muxa.xml
