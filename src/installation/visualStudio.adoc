The following describes how to compile 4diac FORTE with win32-architecture using Visual Studio. 
In the installation tutorial xref:./install.adoc#ownFORTE[(back)] you find more details on building your own 4diac FORTE. 
Additionally, other tools are described there.

IMPORTANT: If you are using a Visual Studio version older then 2010 you might need to extend it with a stdint.h file. 
See for example http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12970293/why-microsoft-visual-studio-cannot-find-stdint-h[here.]

== Building a MS Visual Studio Project for 4diac FORTEwith CMake

In the xref:./install.adoc#ownFORTE[installation tutorial], the steps on building a project with CMake are described in detail. 
To use Visual Studio, you need to however select the tool MS Visual Studio. 
The correct architecture is Win32.

. Open the CMake-GUI.
. Choose the source folder `FORTE_FOLDER_ROOT`.
. Choose desired destination folder. We recommend `FORTE_FOLDER_ROOT/bin/win32`.
. Press the [.button4diac]#Configure# button and choose the version of Visual Studio that is used and native default compilers. 
  Press the [.button4diac]#Finish# button afterwards.
. For the option [.specificText]#FORTE_ARCHITECTURE#, select Win32. 
  Other modules and configurations options can be set following the tutorial step link:./install.adoc#generateFilesForCompiling[Build a project with CMake].
. Press the [.button4diac]#Configure# button, check red rows and repeat this until no row appears red. Afterwards, press the button [.button4diac]#Generate#.

== Compile 4diac FORTEwith Visual Studio

. Open the generated 4diac FORTEproject (.sln file) with Visual Studio in `FORTE_FOLDER_ROOT/bin/win32`. 
  You can change from Debug to Release mode if you don't want to debug.

. Build 4diac FORTEafterwards by right-clicking on [.button4diac]#forte# in the Solution Explorer window and then clicking [.button4diac]#Build#.
  A file `forte.exe` should be generated in `FORTE_FOLDER_ROOT/bin/win32/src/Release`.
