An overview is presented in this step 0 - about elements, perspectives
and properties of 4diac IDE that you need to know about to use it
smoothly.

[[startingUp]]
=== Starting up 4diac IDE

Open 4diac IDE to start the tutorial. You will be prompted to select or
create your workspace. For this tutorial, we name our workspace
"Tutorial". A workspace is a folder on your computer that stores one or
more 4diac IDE projects.

image:./img/Step0/workspaceSelection.png[workspace selection]

After you created a workspace, 4diac IDE presents its welcome screen.
Here you can get an overview about 4diac IDE, create a new project,
import an existing project or read more about the chapters of the
tutorial.

image:./img/Step0/welcomeScreen.png[welcome screen of
4diac IDE]

At first it's best to deselect the checkbox at the bottom-right corner
so you can start up 4diac IDE faster the next time. You can open the
welcome screen later again via Help → Welcome.

Next you click the _workbench_ button. This brings you to the main
screen of 4diac IDE.

[[elements]]
=== 4diac IDE Elements

Since 4diac IDE is compliant to the IEC 61499 standard, 4diac IDE
provides the standard's elements for work (you can check
link:../../html/before4DIAC/iec61499.adoc#IEC61499[here] to revise):

* image:./img/system.png[System]
[.inlineTitle]#System#: It contains the [.view4diac]#System
Configuration# and its corresponding [.element61499]#Applications#.
* image:./img/app16.png[Application]
[.inlineTitle]#Application#: It contains the desired application in
terms of a FB network.
* image:./img/device16.png[Device]
[.inlineTitle]#Device#: It represents a hardware device such as a
programmable logic controller (PLC) or a microcontroller.
* image:./img/resource16.png[Resource]
[.inlineTitle]#Resource#: It is responsible for the execution of the
control logic within its own execution context.
* [.inlineTitle]#Function blocks (FB)#:
** image:./img/basicfb_16.png[BFB]
[.inlineTitle]#Basic FB (BFB)#: It uses an execution control chart (ECC)
to control event execution. Algorithms are associated with the different
states inside an ECC.
** image:./img/compositefb_16.png[CFB]
[.inlineTitle]#Composite FB (CFB)#: It contains a FB network of existing
FBs. Its FB interface passes events and data on to the FBs within the
CFB, which in turn pass events and data among themselves and out to the
CFB's normal output interface.
** image:./img/sifb_16.png[SIFB]
[.inlineTitle]#Service interface FB (SIFB)#: It is usually used for
something that cannot be done within the IEC 61499 standard such as
communication with devices or network segments. It helps to first
understand basic and composite FBs. SIFBs are then used to realize only
what cannot be done using a BFB/CFB.
* image:./img/adapter.png[Adapter]
[.element61499]#Adapter#: It combines a set of input/output events and
data to one connection. On the one hand it simplifies the IEC 61499
[.element61499]#Application# and on the other hand it better decouples
[.element61499]#Application# parts providing an interface concept, which
allows adopting the polymorphic concept of object-oriented programming

[[perspectives]]
=== 4diac IDE Perspectives

The 4diac IDE provides three perspectives, which can be added via the
image:./img/perspective/new_persp.gif[add perspective]
button in the upper-right corner:

image:./img/Step0/perspectiveSelection.png[perspective
selection]

. The [.inlineTitle]## image:./img/system.png[System
Perspective Button] System ##perspective is used to configure everything
regarding your system. It includes:
* [.inlineTitle]#System Manager#, which allows creating and editing your
System and Applications.
* [.inlineTitle]#System Configuration#, which allows managing
[.element61499]#Devices#, [.element61499]#Resources# and
[.element61499]#Segments# according to IEC 61499. The
[.element61499]#Resources# are used for [.element61499]#Application#
mapping and insertion of communication function blocks to other
[.element61499]#Devices# and [.element61499]#Resources#.
* [.inlineTitle]#Applications# according to the IEC 61499
[.element61499]#Application# Model
. [.inlineTitle]#
image:./img/perspective/deploymentButton.gif[Deployment
Perspective Button] Deployment # perspective, where the
[.element61499]#Applications# are launched and tested.
. [.inlineTitle]#
image:./img/perspective/debugButton.gif[Debug
Perspective Button] 4diac IDE Debug # perspective, where
[.element61499]#Applications# can be monitored.

[[systemPerspective]]
==== System Perspective

The perspective can be changed in the upper-right corner. The System
perspective is reached via the
image:./img/system.png[System Perspective Button]
button. The System perspective is divided into the following five areas:

. [.inlineTitle]#System Management area#, which is used for managing
IEC 61499 compliant applications and configuring
[.element61499]#Devices# and [.element61499]#Resources#. The
[.IDEelement]#Type Navigator# is in a tab next to it and lists the
available function block library for every [.element61499]#System# as
well as the default library.
. [.inlineTitle]#Editor area#, which contains the
[.IDEelement]#Application editor# for modeling of control applications,
the [.IDEelement]#System editor# for modeling the
[.element61499]#System# configuration, and the [.IDEelement]#Device# and
[.IDEelement]#Resource editor# for modeling the
[.element61499]#Resource# configuration.
. [.inlineTitle]#Outline# of [.element61499]#Applications#,
[.element61499]#System# configurations, [.element61499]#Devices#, and
[.element61499]#Resources#
. [.inlineTitle]#Property view#, which allows parameterizing function
block instances, [.element61499]#Devices#, and
[.element61499]#Resources#

image:./img/perspective/systemPerspective.png[System
Perspective Button]

[[deploymentPerspective]]
==== Deployment Perspective

The perspective can be changed in the upper-right corner. The
[.view4diac]#Deployment perspective# is reached by the
image:./img/perspective/deploymentButton.gif[Deployment
Perspective Button] button. The [.view4diac]#Deployment Management#
perspective is divided into the following four areas:

. Deployment Selection for selecting a [.element61499]#System#,
[.element61499]#Devices# or [.element61499]#Resources# which have to be
deployed to controller runtimes
. Deployment Console for visualizing deployment messages
. Runtime Launcher and button Deploy, which start the deployment process
and launch IEC 61499 compliant runtimes
. Console output if the runtime is running locally.

Perspective Button]

[[debugPerspective]]
==== Debug Perspective

The perspective can be changed in the upper-right corner. The
[.view4diac]#Debug perspective# is reached via the
image:./img/perspective/debugButton.gif[Debug
Perspective Button] button. The [.view4diac]#Debug perspective# is
divided into the following four areas:

. System selection, where Systems can be marked for monitoring by
right-clicking and choosing [.menu4diac]#Monitor System.#
. Application editor, which shows your [.element61499]#Application# and
highlights the variables marked for watching.
. Watches view, which allows watching the current values of the
variables you marked for watching.
. Outline of [.element61499]#Applications#, [.element61499]#System#
configurations, [.element61499]#Devices#, and [.element61499]#Resources#

Perspective Button]

[[preferences]]
=== 4diac IDE Preferences

Before starting the engineering process of IEC 61499
[.element61499]#Applications#, you should set the preferences for the
4diac IDE under [.menu4diac]#Window → Preferences → 4diac IDE#.

Later in _Step 1 - Use 4diac IDE locally_, you'll learn more about the
preferences. For now it is good to know that there are different
preference pages, where various parameter for the 4diac IDE can be set
(e.g. connection colors). In order to use the Runtime Launcher of the
link:#deploymentPerspective[deployment perspective], the location of the
run-time executable files must be set in the properties. Currently two
runtime environments are supported:

. http://www.eclipse.org/4diac/en_rte.php[4diac Forte]:
[.fileLocation]#path/forte.exe#
. https://www.holobloc.com/[Holobloc's FBRT]:
[.fileLocation]#path/fbrt.jar#

=== Toolbar

Selecting an element (e.g. [.element61499]#Systems#,
[.element61499]#Devices#, [.element61499]#Resources#,
[.element61499]#Applications#, [.element61499]#Function Blocks#, ...)
and pressing the right mouse button opens the context menu with several
menus to manipulate the specific element. Additionally, the following
items are provided in the permanent toolbar located below the menu:

* image:./img/properties/hideEvent.png[Hide Events]
and image:./img/properties/hideData.png[Hide Data]
allow hiding either the event or the data connections in the
[.view4diac]#Application Editor# Editor
* image:./img/properties/icon_print.png[Print Icon]
allows printing the [.element61499]#Applications# and the Automation
Hardware
* image:./img/properties/icon_save.png[Save Icon]
allows saving changes from the toolbar or the file (Save or Save All is
used), alternative access by pressing [.inlineCode]#Ctrl + S#
* image:./img/properties/undoredo.png[Undo/Redo Icon]
provides undo and/or redo of last changes
* image:./img/properties/zoom.png[Zoom Functionality]
provides zoom functionality in the toolbar or the menu entries in the
context menu of an editor but also by pressing [.button4diac]#Ctrl#
while scrolling the mouse wheel
* Function Block instances or [.element61499]#Devices# can be deleted
pressing [.button4diac]#DEL# or selecting the context menu entry Delete.
* Instance names of Function Blocks, [.element61499]#Resources# or
[.element61499]#Devices# can be changed. The instance name field can be
edited in the properties view. When a function block is selected, its
properties are displayed at the bottom of the window. Additionally, a
slow double-click also allows editing the name: First, select the FB by
clicking onto it and, then, click on the FB again to edit the instance
name. +
