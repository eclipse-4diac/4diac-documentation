== Step 1 - Use 4diac Locally (Blinking Tutorial)

This page is part of a guide that gives a walk-through over the major
4diac IDE features.

In this tutorial you create a simple Blinking application. It's the
"Hello World" of automation programs, so it teaches the key aspects and
workflow of 4diac IDE. The application will run locally, so no
connection to any PLC or external hardware is needed. The architecture
is shown below.

the current step]

After completing Step 0 switch to the system perspective using the
image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/system.png[System Perspective Button]
Button.

[[createSystem]]
=== Create a new IEC 61499 System

. In the upper left corner of the system perspective there is the main
menu. Create a new project by selecting +
[.menu4diac]#File → New → 4diac IDE Project...#
. Follow the instructions in the creation wizard. For this tutorial we
name our new system _BlinkTest_.
+
image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step1/newSystemWizard.png[Create a new IEC
61499 System]

The system appears in the [.view4diac]#System Explorer# on the left,
click on the _BlinkTest_ to unfold the tree. There you can see three
things now:

* *__BlinkTest__App*: The automatically generated initial control
application. The name can be freely chosen. Your application is located
here.
* *System Configuration*: The definition of the devices present in your
System.
* *Type Library*: You find here all the available Function Blocks for
this System.

By default, new systems contain a copy of the types in the Type Library.
If different types are needed, for example from another project or
another IEC 61499 engineering tool, these type files can be easily added
by copying them into the project directory to the desired location.
Furthermore the [.view4diac]#Type Navigator# allows to drag and drop
types between projects as well as within a project to a different
folder.

[[createNetwork]]
=== Create a FB Network for the Blink Application

A double-click on an Application in the System Explorer tab on the left
opens the Application Editor for this specific application in the editor
area.

. Drag and Drop the following Function Blocks (FBs) to the Editor. Open
the palette (if not already open) on the upper right of *editor area* by
clicking on the left arrow or use the Type Library in the System
Explorer. The three FBs are in the [.folderLocation]#events# folder:
* E_CYCLE
* E_SWITCH
* E_SR
+
You can also double-click the editor area and search for the FBs.
image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step1/blinkFBs.png[Function Blocks for the
blink example]
+
The name in the middle of the FB is its type. If you CTRL + click on it,
you can access the definition of the type of the FB. There you can see
the interface and how it works. Check E_SWITCH and E_SR and go to the
ECC tab to see how they behave.
+
The name on top of the FB is the instance name. Two FBs cannot have the
same instance name. You can double-click on it to change it for a better
organized application.
. Create the connections between the FBs
+
*Event* (red, on top part of FBs) and *Data* (blue, on lower part of
FBs) *connections* can be generated by connecting the Event-/Data in-
and outputs. Position the mouse pointer over an Event-/Data in- or
output, click and drag to the other end of the connection to create one.
Remember, Event and Data connections cannot be mixed. Events connections
allow fan-in and fan-out. Data connections allow fan-out but not fan-in.
+
image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step1/blinkWithConnections.png[Function
Blocks for the blink example]
+
Here are some tips for editing the application:
* If you hover the mouse over a FB or Data or Event connection end,
you'll get information about it.
* If you try to connect Data connections that have incompatible types,
you will see a red error in the status bar at the lowest part of
4diac IDE.
* Selected function blocks in the [.view4diac]#Application Editor# can
be parameterized using the [.view4diac]#Properties View# typically
located below.
* The colors of the connections may differ. Remember you can change them
in [.menu4diac]#Window → Preferences → 4diac IDE#
. Set a literal as an input data connection. The DT input data
connection of E_CYCLE must be set to a value in order for it to work.
You can do it by either:
* Double click on the data connection in the Application Editor
* Select the DT of the FB and change the value in the Properties tab
below or double-click on DT and set the value directly
+
Set the value to [.specificText]#T#1s#, meaning 1 second.
+
image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step1/blinkComplete.png[Function Blocks
for the blink example]

Now the application is done. You should try to understand how the
application works. Something missing is the starting event. This would
be done later when the hardware is configured. For now, imagine an event
arrives to E_CYCLE.START. Every 1 second, an event output will be
triggered in E_CYCLE.EO. The E_SWITCH will trigger an event output EO0
when G is zero, and EO1 when G is one. The value Q of E_SR will be 1
when an event at S arrive and 0 when an event at R arrive. Try to follow
the flow of events and understand why this application makes Q toggle,
considering it starts at 0.

[[configureHardware]]
=== Configuration of the Automation Hardware

First, let's define the devices that are present in our system. The
automation hardware can be modelled with the [.view4diac]#System
Configuration Editor#. It can be opened by double clicking on the
[.view4diac]#System Configuration# tree node in the [.view4diac]#System
Explorer# on the left. By using Drag and Drop, Device, Resource and
Segment types can be added from the palette. On an IEC 61499 Device
several IEC 61499 Resources can be configured. Resources can be directly
added to Devices.

Drag and Drop a

. [.element4diac]#FORTE_PC# Device
. [.element4diac]#Ethernet# Segment

from the Palette.

Connect them by clicking on one and dragging to the other. The segment
is divided in two areas, the left is for moving, the right for
connections. The device can be connected by clicking on the device type
(second row). One EMB_RES resource is already present in the device. The
MGR_ID [.address]#localhost:61499# specifies the IP:PORT where the
device will run. In this case it'll run locally and will listen at the
port 61499.

image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step1/systemConfigurationEditor.png[System
Configuration Editor]

The color is automatically generated for better orientation in the
system. When several devices or segments are in use, you can see at a
glance where the FB belongs to. If you like to change the color, click
on the device or segment. In the property view on the bottom of the
screen you find the tab Appearance. Here you can choose a color you like
best.

Check that the Profile in the Properties tab is set to HOLOBLOC.

For this tutorial we give the device the name _testee_. Device names
help us to distinguish the different devices from each other. Names can
be changed in the property view or by double-clicking on the name. +
The *resource* is automatically generated for your convenience. EMB_RES
stands for Embedded Resource. We named it _Blinky_RES_.

image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step1/changeResourceName.png[changing the
name of the Resource]

Device and Resource parameters can either be specified directly at each
Device/Resource or via the Properties View. The [.view4diac]#Properties
View# shows the parameters of a IEC 61499 Device/Resource (if it is
selected either in the [.view4diac]#System Configuration Editor# or in
the [.view4diac]#System Manager View#). The most important parameters
are the IP address and the port of the device management interface as
they are required for the communication between the engineering tool and
the Devices (e.g. Download of IEC 61499 Applications).

[[deviceProfileConfiguration]]
==== Configuration of the Device's Configuration Profile

In order to support different device vendors' download mechanism you
need to specify the device profile to be used for your device. currently
4diac IDE supports the following two device profiles:

* [.specificText]#HOLOBLOC# Device conforming to the
[.specificText]#"IEC 61499 Compliance Profile for Feasibility
Demonstrations"#. Currently the devices supporting this profile are all
[.specificText]#FORTE# devices and [.specificText]#FBDK# devices older
than 2009.
* [.specificText]#FBDK2# for FBDK devices version 2 or later.

[[mapNetworks]]
=== Mapping of Function Block Networks to Devices/Resources

Mapping FBs means defining in which device each FBs will run. All mapped
FBs are changing their fill color to the device's color during the
mapping process.

Go to the Application created before, select the FBs you want to map by
left-clicking or drawing a rectangle over it (in this case all of them),

[.menu4diac]#right click → Map to ... → FORTE_PC → Blinky_RES#

image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step1/mappingInAppEditor.png[Mapping of
Function Block Instances within the Application Editor]

To unmap a Function Block instance from a Resource, use the context menu
entry [.menu4diac]#Unmap# of a Function Block in the corresponding
[.button4diac]#Application#.

[[configureResource]]
=== Configure the Resource

You can open the *Resource Editor* by double clicking the Resource
(_Blinky_RES_) in the System Configuration, or in the tree in the System
Explorer on the left.

There you can find a START function block in white. This is the default
starter function block of the EMB_RES. This will trigger a COLD event
when starting. The STOP is triggered when the PLC is set to a STOP
state, and the WARM when the PLC changes from a STOP state back to a RUN
state. Connect both COLD and WARM to E_CYCLE.START.

image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step1/resourceComplete.png[Resource
completely connected]

You also see the FBs that were previously mapped. You can add more FBs
directly here and they will be already mapped to the resource, or you
can unmap the FBs.

[[overviewEditors]]

[[deployingToForte]]
=== Deploying Application to 4diac FORTE

In this step, the Blink application will be deployed to 4diac FORTE
running locally on your computer.

. You have to select a 4diac FORTE. +
You can either build your own 4diac FORTE as
link:../../html/installation/install.html#ownFORTE[shown here] or you
can download the 4diac FORTE image that is provided for you for this
tutorial on https://eclipse.dev/4diac/en_dow.php[our Homepage]. You can
save the .exe wherever you like, we have chosen F:\4diac\4diac IDE\. Go
to [.menu4diac]#Windows → Preferences → 4diac IDE → FORTE Preferences#,
and in [.addressDoc]#FORTE Location# look for the 4diac FORTE executable
and then click _Apply and Close_. +
image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step1/selectForte.png[select your
4diac FORTE,width=600]
. Change to the _Deployment Perspective_ using the
image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/perspective/deploymentButton.gif[Deployment
Perspective Button] button.
. Set the port to 61499 (the same define before, remember
[.address]#localhost:61499# in the System Configuration?)
. [.button4diac]#Launch Local 4diac FORTE#
. You should see the the location of your 4diac FORTE and the
*Terminate* button enabled in the Console.
. Select the elements to deploy. For this tutorial select our device
_Testee_. In case you have many devices with many resources, you can
select the devices to deploy and even which resources to deploy.
. Click the [.button4diac]#Deploy# button
. Check that the _Deployment Console_ shows some output, and that no red
warning appears on the right nor left of it. If you get something red,
something went wrong.

image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step1/deploymentExample.png[deploying of
the application]

[.noteTitle]##Note:##[.noteText]## With the runtime launcher you can
only start run-time environments on your local development computer. It
is not possible to start run-time environments on remote computers or
control devices. In order to perform this task device specific means to
start the run-time environment have to be performed.##

The _Deployment Console_ is automatically cleared before each download.
Furthermore, with the icon
image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/clearDeploymentConsole.png[Clear
Deployment Console] in the upper right corner of the _Deployment
Console_ the deployment messages can be cleared.

By selecting a Device or Resource the corresponding IEC 61499 element
can be cleaned. This means that the Device or Resource configuration are
cleaned and reset to the default configuration without any Function
Block Network.

[.menu4diac]#Delete All Resources# leaves the Device empty, and
[.menu4diac]#Kill Device# stops 4diac FORTE. You can deploy again after
cleaning the Device.

[.menu4diac]#Delete Resource# deletes just the selected resource:

Devive or Resource,width=1024]

[[monitoringApplication]]
=== Monitoring the Application

To observe the outputs of your Application you can use 4diac's
monitoring functionality. You can enable it in the Toolbar under the
Toolbar icon:
image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/properties/startMon.gif[Monitoring] or
doing the following:

. Change to Debug Perspective using the
image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/perspective/debugButton.gif[Debug
Perspective Button] button.
. In the System Explorer, right click on the System → Monitor System
+
image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step1/enableMonitoring.png[Resource
completely connected]

A green circle will appear in the system icon indicating that monitoring
is enabled for the system. To watch variables, you can:

* Right Click on a [.menu4diac]#FB → Watch All# or
* Right Click on a [.menu4diac]#Variable → Watch#
+
image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step1/monitoringWatch.png[Resource
completely connected]

The Data and Events are monitored. The Data shows the current value and
the Events show the times it was triggered. You can watch on the
directly on the Element or in the Watches view.

Now you can see that _true_ and _false_ alternate. If a controller
output were connected, a light would now blink at 1 second intervals.

image:../../html/4diacIDE/img/Step1/monitoringWatching.png[Resource
completely connected]

You can force values to data inputs and trigger events by right clicking
on it and selecting the corresponding command.
