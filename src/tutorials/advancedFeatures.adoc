This page shows some advanced features about 4diac IDE that are usually used in more complicated applications:

. Subapplications (implemented since version 1.9)


== [[adaptersUsage]]Adapter Usage

[.element61499]#Adapters# group interface elements into reusable interface descriptions. 
They reduce the number of interface elements (event and data inputs and outputs) and by that the number of connections that have to be created between interacting function blocks.
In 4diac IDE, [.element61499]#adapters# are listed in the type library and represented by this symbol:
image:./img/4diacIDE/img/adapter/adapter.png[adapter].


=== [[newAdapterType]]Create a new Adapter Type

These interface descriptions can be added to the interface of any Function Block Type. 
Currently, [.element61499]#adapters# can not contain other adapters. 
There are two types of [.element61499]#adapters#, which are mirrored interfaces:

image::./img/adapter/plugAndSocket.png[socket and plug.]

* [.element61499]#socket#: added as [.element4diac]#input# of a function block and represented by this symbol image:./img/adapter/sockets_16.png[socket of adapter] within the function block's interface.
* [.element61499]#plug#: added as [.element4diac]#output# of a function block and represented by this symbol image:./img/adapter/plugs_16.png[plug of adapter] within the function block's interface.

When a new [.element61499]#adapter# is created, it should be a [.element4diac]#socket#. 
The mirrored plug is derived automatically by 4diac IDE and is [.specificText]#NOT# created by the user. 
An adapter (socket) is created by [.command4diac]#File → New → New Type# and selecting [.menu4diac]#Adapter.adp# as Type. 
All adapter names should start with an [.specificText]#A# (naming convention).

=== [[useAdapterType]]Use Your new Adapter Type

After creating your desired adapter type (socket), it can be added to a function block's interface by drag and drop from the Palette, as illustrated in the following figure.

The function blocks used within the following application snippet are part of the TrafficLight example system. 
Two different adapter types have been used, `ATimeOut` in `PedLightCtl_AT` and `E_TimeOut` and `ATrafficLight` in `PedLightCtl_AT`.

The `PedLightCtl_AT` is a basic function block. Within basic function blocks adapters are accessed by `FB_INTERFACE_NAME.ADAPTER_INTERFACE_NAME`. 
The elements of the `ATimeOut` adapter are therefore accessed by `timeOut.START`, `timeOut.STOP` and `timeOut.TimeOut`.

The `E_TimeOut` is a composite function block. 
Within the network of a composite function block, any adapter added to its interface is represented by an adapter block which looks like a Function Block. 
The interface elements of this adapter block are connected like a function block.

Further examples for the usage of adapters can be found within the FestoMPS example system.
