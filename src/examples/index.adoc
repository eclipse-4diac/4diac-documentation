== [[noHardwareRequired]]General Examples

For the following examples, you don't need any special hardware:

* xref:./xplus3.adoc[X+3]: This example uses 2 devices, 1 running 4diac FORTE and the other running FBRT. 
  It has a really simple logic that allows the user to interact by inputing a number that's sent to 4diac FORTE, which add 3 to the input and returns the result which is shown back to the user.


== [[hardwareRequired]]Specific Hardware Required Examples

For the following examples, you'll need specific hardware to try them:

* xref:./pidMotor.adoc[PID control on Lego Mindstorms Motor]: 
  This example uses the Lego Mindstorms EV3. 
  It creates a Basic Function Block that implements a PID control on the position of a motor.
* link:./bbbTrafficControl.adoc[Traffic control example running on a Beagle Bone Black]: 
  This is the Traffic Control that comes with Eclipse 4diac, but instead of running locally, the control runs on a BBB and the HMI locally. 
  This example is important because it finds many networking issues that are solved.
