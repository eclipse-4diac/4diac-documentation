== Library Handling
Libraries get introduced into the project through the available import wizards which update the project manifest as necessary.
The libraries are referenced through symbolic links to avoid unnecessary copying.

=== Storage Location
There are three separate locations:

* *Standard Libraries* come bundled with the 4diac distribution
* *Archives* are stored in the `+.download+` folder of the workspace
* *Libraries* are stored in the `+.lib+` folder of the workspace

=== Project Startup
On opening a project, a background task checks the project manifest for dependencies and proceeds as follows:

. Check if fitting library version is already linked
. If that's not the case, search and link a fitting version in `.lib`
. If none were found, try to download it through configured download sources

== Library Structure
* A folder named `+<SymbolicName>-<Version>+` containing:
** A `+MANIFEST.MF+` file defining the library
** A folder named `+typelib+` holding the library contents (function blocks, structs, types, etc.)

Library archives (in zip format) are expected to only contain this folder.

== Manifest file
An XML-document holding all information concerning libraries used by both libraries and projects.
The following parts are shared by both:

* Scope (attribute) - either `+Library+` or `+Project+`
* Dependencies (optional) - references to other needed libraries
** Required (0 to unbounded) - reference 
*** SymbolicName (attribute) - symbolic name of library dependency
*** Version (attribute) - link:#versionRange[version range] of library dependency
* Product (required) - base information about project/library
** VersionInfo (required)
*** Author (attribute) - author name
*** Date (attribute) - creation/modification date (ISO 8601 date)
*** Version (attribute) - version of the project/library

=== [[libraryManifest]]Library Manifest
Has the following additions:

* Product 
** Name (attribute) - display name
** SymbolicName (attribute) - symbolic name
** Comment (attribute) - comment/description

=== [[projectManifest]]Project Manifest
Has the following additions:

* Exports (optional) - contains libraries to be exported from this project
** Library (0 to unbounded) - library export definition
*** Name, SymbolicName, Comment - equivalent to link:#libraryManifest[library manifest]
*** Includes (required) - filters for including types in the exported library
**** LibraryElement (0 to unbounded) - link:#libraryElement[filter pattern] for inclusion
*** Excludes (optional) - filters for excluding types 
**** LibraryElement (0 to unbounded) - link:#libraryElement[filter pattern] for exclusion

=== [[versionRange]]Version (Range)
The version format used is `+major.minor.micro+` with all three parts being positive integers.
Standard value for all of them is zero which leads to `+1+` being equivalent to `+1.0+` and `+1.0.0+`.

The version range (used in dependencies) is formatted as `+<left><version>-<version><right>+`, 
with `+<left>+` as `+[+` (inclusive) or `+(+` (exclusive) and `+<right>+` as  `+]+` (inclusive) or `+)+` (exclusive).
The special case `+<version>+` will be interpreted as `+[<version>-<version>]+` (a range only containing that version).

=== [[libraryElement]]Library Element
Filter pattern for inclusion/exclusion of types into an exported library, consisting of the following:

* Identifiers - as defined by IEC61131-3
* `+::+` - package delimiter
* `+*+` - match any identifier
* `+**+` - match any identifier over one or more levels

Examples:

* `+A::B::C+` - match a specific type
* `+test::**+` - match anything directly inside `+test+` (but not `+test:a:b+` as an example)
* `+test::**+` - match anything inside `+test+` and its lower levels
* `+**::basetype+` - match any occurrence of `+basetype+` wherever it is (but not `+basetype+` without any package)
* `+*::test::**+` - match anything that has `+test+` as its second hierarchy level
