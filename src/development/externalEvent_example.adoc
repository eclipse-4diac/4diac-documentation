= [[topOfPage]]External Event SIFB
:lang: en


External Events are events in 4diac FORTE, which are hidden and can not be seen in 4diac IDE. 
They do not appear as red event lines. 
They are  usually used for Communication between Hardware and Function Blocks.
For example,  `E_CYCLE` is a Function Block that uses this functionality. 
It registers to the `CTimerHandler` class to get External Events in a periodic time.

== Receiving External Events

This is an advanced example showing how to make your own timed T-Flip-Flop Service Interface Function Block. 
It is based on the `E_CYCLE` Block and works quite the same way. 
This tutorial shows you how to build it from scratch. 
Consider that this is just an example that does not follow the IEC 61499 standard.

=== The Interface

T Flip-Flop as SIFB with integrated Timer.
xref:../tutorials/createOwnTypes.adoc#exportTypes[Export the interface to 4diac FORTE] (`*.h` and `*.cpp` files) and xref:../installation/install.adoc#externalModules[include them to your build].

=== Edit the Headerfile

This time we want to create a timed `SIFB` so we do not inherit from `CFunctionBlock`. 
Instead we inherit from `CEventSourceFB`. 
A `CEventSourceFB` can react to External Events. 
Therefore you should correct the first line of your class declaration like this:
----
class FORTE_SIFB_T_FF3 : public CEventSourceFB\{
----

In this case we want to get External Events from the included Timer handler. 
Include the 2 files `timerha.h` and `resource.h` and change `funcbloc.h` to `esfb.h`. 
Your include parameters should look like this:

----
#include "timerha.h" //added 
#include "resource.h" //added 
#include "esfb.h" //instead of #include "funcbloc.h" 
#include "forte_time.h"
#include "forte_bool.h"
----

Then we need a new Constructor as well as two new private members `bool mActive;` which will indicate that the timed Function Block is currently active.

----
EVENT_SOURCE_FUNCTION_BLOCK_CTOR(FORTE_SIFB_T_FF3){
	    setEventChainExecutor(pa_poSrcRes->getResourceEventExecution());
	    mActive = false;
};
----

Remove the default constructor `FUNCTION_BLOCK_CTOR` and replace it with above. 
This constructor registers this Function Block as a External Event Listener, that triggers this Function Block if an event occurs. 
Then the timer list entry is configured.

=== Edit the Source File

Then you need to edit the `executeEvent` method. 
The usual start and stop Events will register this block to the `CTimerHandler`. 
Add a new event `cgExternalEventID`, which is defined in `CEventSourceFB`, and let it set your outputs. 
This will be triggered if your Function Block receives an External Event.

----
void FORTE_SIFB_T_FF3::executeEvent(TEventID paEIID, CEventChainExecutionThread *const paECET){
  switch(paEIID){
	case cg_nExternalEventID:
	  Q() = !Q();
	  sendOutputEvent(scm_nEventEOID, paECET);
	  break;
	case scm_nEventSTOPID:
	  if(m_bActive){
		CTimerHandler::sm_poFORTETimer->unregisterTimedFB(this);
		m_bActive = false;
	  }
	  break;
	case scm_nEventSTARTID:
	  if(!m_bActive){
		CTimerHandler::sm_poFORTETimer->registerPeriodicTimedFB(this, DT());
		m_bActive = true;
	  }
	  break;
	default:
	  break;
  }
}
----

Compile 4diac FORTE and run it. 
Test your new Function Block with the tester. 
If something went wrong, compare your code with the following files.

== Sending External Events

To send External Events your Class must inherit from `CExternalEventHandler`. 
In the Constructor you must register this class:

----
m_nExtEvHandID = sm_poDeviceExecution->registerExternalEventHandler(this);
----

Then you can send External Events with:
----
if(sm_poDeviceExecution->extEvHandlerIsAllowed(m_nExtEvHandID)) {
  sm_poDeviceExecution->startNewEventChain(pointerToTargetFB); 
}
----
