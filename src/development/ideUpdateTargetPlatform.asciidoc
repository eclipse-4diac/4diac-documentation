** Locate https://github.com/eclipse-4diac/4diac-ide/blob/develop/plugins/org.eclipse.fordiac.ide.product/org.eclipse.fordiac.ide.product.target
** Open it in a plain text editor
** Go through all entries check for new urls and new versions
** At the end open the `org.eclipse.fordiac.ide.product.target` in the target editor to verify all upgrades work. Resolve any problems accordingly
* Update pom.xml in the 4diac IDE's source root directory. 
  At least the following steps have to be done:
** Check tycho.version
** Update tycho-repo.url to the new target platform version
** Check org.eclipse.equinox.executable version range.
