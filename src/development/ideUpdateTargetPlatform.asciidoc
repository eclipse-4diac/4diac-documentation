= [[topOfPage]]Updating the Target Platform used by 4diac IDE
:lang: en


The target platform defines the dependencies of 4diac IDE to other eclipse projects. Currently the 4diac IDE requires the following:

* https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.xx
** Eclipse Java Development Tools, org.eclipse.jdt.feature.group
** Eclipse Platform SDK, org.eclipse.platform.sdk
** Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment, org.eclipse.pde.feature.group
* https://download.eclipse.org/releases/20xx-xx
** EMF - Eclipse Modeling Framework SDK, org.eclipse.emf.sdk.feature.group
** GEF (MVC) SDK, org.eclipse.gef.sdk.feature.group
** Git integration for Eclipse, org.eclipse.egit.feature.group
** OCL classic SDK: Ecore/UML Parsers, Evaluator, Edit, org.eclipse.ocl.all.sdk.feature.group
** Xtext Complete SDK, org.eclipse.xtext.sdk.feature.group
* https://download.eclipse.org/elk/updates/releases/0.x.x
** Eclipse LayoutKernel (Incubation) - Core Components, org.eclipse.elk.feature.feature.group
** Eclipse LayoutKernel (Incubation) - Layout Algorithms, org.eclipse.elk.algorithms.feature.feature.group

For upgrading to new Eclipse platform versions the following steps need to be done:

* Update org.eclipse.fordiac.ide.product.target in the org.eclipse.fordiac.ide.product plug-in
* Update pom.xml in the 4diac IDE's source root directory. 
  At least the following steps have to be done:
** Check tycho.version
** Update tycho-repo.url to the new target platform version
** Check org.eclipse.equinox.executable version range. 
  Attention this has to be done on two places in the file. +
For the version check the latest https://download.eclipse.org/oomph/archive/reports/download.eclipse.org/releases/index.html[release overview page]. 
There check for _Eclipse Platform Launcher Executables_.
* Regenerate all model and model edit code from the models plug-in.
* Run product from Eclipse IDE using product editor, i.e., press the synchronize button and then the "Launch an Eclipse Application"
* Run Maven install for pom.xml in the 4diac IDE's source root directory locally
* Test if the generated product can be executed. The generated products are in: +
`/org.eclipse.4diac.ide/plugins/org.eclipse.fordiac.ide.product/target/products/org.eclipse.fordiac.ide.product
* Push to Gerrit so that CI build can also check if it is working
