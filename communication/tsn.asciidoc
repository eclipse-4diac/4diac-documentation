== How to use Eclipse 4diac's Time Sensitive Networking Communication Interface

[[intro]]
=== Introduction

This tutorial shows how to use 4diac's Time Sensitive Networking (TSN)
features. Some standards of TSN are still in the active standardization
phase (status July 2018) e.g., IEEE802.1ASRev and IEEE802.1Qch. The
advantages of TSN are:

* Convergent network: network traffic with a vast variety of network
requirements are transmitted on a single network cable, hence TSN
improves bandwidth utilization and reduces cabling effort.
* Interoperability: TSN is an IEEE standard extension for the already
existing and broadly used Ethernet.
* Determinism: A correctly configured TSN network guarantees the
transmission of packets to the appropriate receivers.
* Real-Time: On top of determinism TSN networks guarantee the
transmission of network packets within a certain time i.e., a maximum
latency.

4diac's communication layer implements publish-subscribe connections via
Service Interface Function Blocks (SIFB). The publish FBs extended by a
VLAN ID and the message priority, represented in the ID data input
parameter.

=== Limitations

The current implementation was tested on Beaglebone Blacks on debian
with real-time patch (4.1.27-bone-rt-r22) and Ubuntu 16.04LTS.

==== Current limitations

* TSN layer is supported on Linux
* Only supports vlan interfaces with eth0 as its physical network
interface (e.g., eth0.1, eth0.2, .. , eth0.165, ..)

[[build]]
=== How to Build 4diac FORTE with TSN Features

. Checkout the develop branch of 4diac FORTE
+
$ git clone
git://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/4diac/org.eclipse.4diac.forte.git $ cd
org.eclipse.4diac.forte $ git checkout develop
. Create a directory for the binary files and set the appropriate CMake
variables
+
$ mkdir -p bin/posix $ cd bin/posix/ $ cmake ../..
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DFORTE_ARCHITECTURE=Posix -DFORTE_COM_TSN=ON
. Build 4diac FORTE with:
+
$ make
. Run 4diac FORTE with:
+
$ cd src $ ./forte

=== Configure 4diac FORTE's TSN Layer Using a Publish Function Block

The 4diac FORTE TSN enabled IP communication layer maps a UDP stream to
a specific VLAN interface. It binds the stream to a virtual Ethernet
adapter (e.g., eth0.x). The correct tagging with VLAN ID and priority is
used by the TSN enabled network to transmit packets according to their
real-time requirements. The different VLANs are related to different
forwarding and scheduling strategies of the TSN network.

An example of a TSN enabled PUBLISH FB with a standard IP layer
SUBSCRIBER FB is shown in the following figure.

publish SIFB in 4diac] Note: In order to make this example work you have
to route the UDP multicast traffic at the device of the subscriber like
follows:

$ route add -net 239.1.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 dev eth0.3 $ ./forte

... and you have to set up the VLAN interface and its IP address on the
sending device before binding a stream to it for example via:

$ sudo ifconfig eth0.3 up $ sudo ifconfig eth0.3
"your_favorite_IP_address" $ sudo ifconfig eth0.3 netmask
"your_favorite_netmask"
