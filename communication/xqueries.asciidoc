== Access BaseX Database with XQueries

This section will show you how to make applications communicate with a
http://basex.org/[BaseX] database through XQueries. This allows a
component, to initialize itself by accessing its asset administration
shell, in terms of an XML database. The component is controlled by a
specific function block, which produces XQueries to initialize its
inputs with values received or calculated from a BaseX database.

The section is devided into three parts. The first part explains how to
build the 4diac FORTE to run an application which sends XQueries. The
second part explains how to setup your BaseX database. And the thrid
part shows how to create an application within the 4diac IDE which sends
XQueries. The exmple AutomationML file as well as this implementation
has been realized as part of the https://www.basys40.de/[BaSys4.0
project], which receives funding of the
https://www.bmbf.de/en/index.html[Federal Ministry of Education and
Research].

[[build]]
=== Build 4diac FORTE to run an Application which sends XQueries

At first checkout https://github.com/BaseXdb/basex[BaseX from GitHub] to
get the C API from BaseX. In the downloaded folder you find the C API
under _.../basex-api/src/main/c_. Please consider that with the
officially available C API from BaseX the authentification to a BaseX
database currently fails under Windows.

git clone https://github.com/BaseXdb/basex.git

Then configure CMake to build the 4diac FORTE. If you do not know how to
build the 4diac FORTE read the
link:../../html/installation/install.html#ownFORTE[build instructions
first]. Besides the usual configuration activate the Xquery Client.

FORTE_COM_XqueryClient=ON

Press the _Configure_ button in CMake to get the settings for the Xquery
Client. Configure the appearing settings. Under Linux the openSSL
include directory might be at _/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/openssl_.
The openSSL libraries _libcrypto.a_ and _libssl.a_ might be at
_/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/_.

FORTE_BASEX_SRC_DIR=path_to_the_C_API_of_BaseX_which_you_downloaded
OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=path_to_openssl_include_files
OPENSSL_LINK_DIR=path_to_openssl_libraries

Press the _Configure_ button within the CMake GUI until none of the
lines is red. Afterwards press the _Generate_ button of the CMake GUI.
Then build the 4diac FORTE.

[[basex]]
=== Setup your BaseX Database

Get BaseX for your system from http://basex.org/download/[here]. After
starting BaseX, load your AutomationML or XML file into BaseX by
clicking _Database/open and manage_. As an example AutomationML file you
can use the
link:../../html/communication/img/xquery/BaSys_PalletSystem_Model.aml[_Pallet
System Model_]. This example AutomationML file has been created during
the https://www.basys40.de/[BaSys4.0 project], which receives funding of
the https://www.bmbf.de/en/index.html[Federal Ministry of Education and
Research]. Within the _General_ tab enter the path to your file and
select the proper input format. In case you use an AutomationML file or
XML, choose XML. Then press OK. Your database will be loaded. Then a
user and a password is needed to access the created database. To create
it, select _command_ within the drop down under the menubar and type the
following commands into the field next to it.

> create user admin > grant write to admin

You can now test any XQuery within the GUI of BaseX. For further
explanation or in case of any problems please have a look at the
http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Main_Page[manual of BaseX].

To start the entire BaseX server change to the _bin_ directory of your
BaseX installation. Start the BaseX server there. The output should be
the BaseX version and the port where you can reach to your database.

> ./basexserver BaseX 10.4 [Server] Server was started (port: 1984).

In case you used the Java implementation of BaseX the following command
will start the BaseX server. Replace the version number of the following
line by the version number of the JAR file you downloaded.

> java -cp BaseX104.jar org.basex.BaseXServer BaseX 10.4 [Server] Server
was started (port: 1984).

[[application]]
=== Create an Application to send XQueries to BaseX

To send XQueries to your database, create a proper basic function block,
which produces the desired XQueries. The following images show a
possible interface and execution control chart for a basic function
block whicht fetches values from your BaseX database during
initialization.

image:../../html/communication/img/xquery/testFB.png[Test function block
to send XQueries]
image:../../html/communication/img/xquery/testFB_ECC.png[Test function
block to send XQueries]

The algorithm _getVMax_ contains an XQuery which is supposed to
calculate the maximum speed of a roller conveyor from values of the
database. Since the 4diac IDE currently does not provide support for an
XQuery algorithm language, you have to use _AnyText_ as algorithm
language. The _AnyText_ language is interpreted as C++ code during
export of your function block. Your XQuery is assigned to the desired
STRING output of your basic function block, in this case _xVMax_. In
case you also want to replace certain elements in your XQuery, maybe by
values from your function block's interface, you have to split the
String. The interface value is then added as parameter of the _append_
method, supported by the 4diac FORTE, e.g. _name().getValue()_. The rest
of your XQuery is appended afterwards. This could look like the
following algorithm code for _getVMax_.

st_xVMax() = CIEC_STRING("xquery "); st_xVMax().append("let $name :=
'"); st_xVMax().append(st_name().getValue()); st_xVMax().append("' "
"let $component := //InstanceHierarchy/*/InternalElement[@Name=$name] "
"let $compType :=
tokenize($component/RoleRequirements/@RefBaseRoleClassPath/data(),'/')[last()]
" "let $rollerTable :=
$component/InternalElement/RoleRequirements[contains(@RefBaseRoleClassPath,'RollConveyor')]/..
" "let $rollDiameter :=
$rollerTable/Attribute[@Name='RollDiameter']/Value/data() " "let $link
:= tokenize($component/InternalLink/@RefPartnerSideA/data(),':')[1] "
"let $motor :=
//InternalElement[@ID=$link]/RoleRequirements[contains(@RefBaseRoleClassPath,'ElectricMotor')]/..
" "let $gearFactor := $motor/Attribute[@Name='Gearfactor']/Value/data()
" "let $rotSpeed := $motor/Attribute[@Name='Rotational
Speed']/Value/data() " "let $linSpeed := $rotSpeed div (60.0 *
$gearFactor) * (2.0 * 3.1416 * 0.5 * $rollDiameter) " "return
round-half-to-even($linSpeed, 3)");

The XQuery algorithm code for _getPredecessor_ could be as follows:

st_xPredecessor() = CIEC_STRING("xquery ");
st_xPredecessor().append("let $name := '");
st_xPredecessor().append(st_name().getValue());
st_xPredecessor().append("' " "let $links :=
//InstanceHierarchy/InternalElement/InternalLink " "let $cp :=
//InstanceHierarchy/*/InternalElement[@Name=$name] " "let $id :=
$cp/@ID/data() " "let $succId :=
tokenize($links[contains(@RefPartnerSideB, $id)]/@RefPartnerSideA,
':')[1] " "let $successor :=
//InstanceHierarchy/*/InternalElement[@ID=$succId] " "return
$successor/@Name/data() ");

The XQuery algorithm code for _getSuccessor_ could be as follows:

st_xSuccessor() = CIEC_STRING("xquery "); st_xSuccessor().append("let
$name := '"); st_xSuccessor().append(st_name().getValue());
st_xSuccessor().append("' " "let $links :=
//InstanceHierarchy/InternalElement/InternalLink " "let $cp :=
//InstanceHierarchy/*/InternalElement[@Name=$name] " "let $id :=
$cp/@ID/data() " "let $succId :=
tokenize($links[contains(@RefPartnerSideA, $id)]/@RefPartnerSideB,
':')[1] " "let $successor :=
//InstanceHierarchy/*/InternalElement[@ID=$succId] " "return
$successor/@Name/data() ");

Please consider that your XQuery is dependent on the data structure of
your database. In this case it is the structure of an AutomationML file
for a link:img/xquery/BaSys_PalletSystem_Model.aml[_Pallet System_].
After you have created your test function block, export it and build
your 4diac FORTE with it. Please have a look at the
link:../../html/installation/install.html#ownFORTE[build instructions]
if you do not know how to build your own function block.

Now you can use your test function block wihtin an application. To send
the XQueries to your BaseX database, add a [.inlineCode]#CLIENT_1# for
each query you want to send. Please consider that currently only a
[.inlineCode]#CLIENT_1# is supported, where you connect the
[.inlineCode]#SD_1# input with the xquery producing output of your test
function block. The result of the XQuery is received by the
[.inlineCode]#RD_1# output. A possible test application is shown in the
following image. Within this application a roller conveyor is
initialized by its maximum speed, and its neighbouring roller conveyors.

image:../../html/communication/img/xquery/testApp.png[Test function
block to send XQueries]

The [.inlineCode]#ID# input of the [.inlineCode]#CLIENT_1# function
block contains a variable [.inlineCode]#%local%# which is replaced by a
proper value during deployment. The [.inlineCode]#ID# is configured with
the protocol name, the IP address of the computer, where your BaseX
database is running, the port where your BaseX server listens for
requests, the name of your database, a user name and a password. For the
example database running on your local machine, the [.inlineCode]#ID#
can be as follows:

xquery[127.0.0.1:1984; BaSys_PalletSystem_Model; admin; admin]

After you have completed your application, mapp your application to a
proper device and start the 4diac FORTE you built before. Then deploy
your application to the 4diac FORTE you started. If everything worked
correctly the 4diac FORTE should produce something like that:

INFO: T#00ms: FORTE is up and running INFO: T#00ms: Using default
bootfile location: forte.fboot INFO: T#00ms: Boot file forte.fboot could
not be opened. Skipping... INFO: T#0100722ms: Connection closed by peer
INFO: T#0100737ms: Connected to DB. INFO: T#0101026ms: DB
BaSys_PalletSystem_Model opend.

If you monitor your application you should get the results from the
XQuery requests at the corresponding inputs of your test function block.
