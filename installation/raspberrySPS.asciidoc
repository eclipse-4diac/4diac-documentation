== Building 4diac FORTE on Raspberry-SPS

=== Introduction

The http://raspberry-sps.de/[Raspberry-SPS] consists of a Raspberry-PI
which is a low-cost embedded system with an ARM processor @700Mhz and
512MB RAM and additional modules such as digital and analog modules.
This tutorial shows how to cross-compile 4diac FORTE for the
Raspberry-SPS. For a general introduction to building 4diac FORTE, see
the link:../../html/installation/install.html[installation tutorial].

=== Preparation

. Download the proper toolchain for your operating system where you plan
to build 4diac FORTE
https://releases.linaro.org/archive/15.06/components/toolchain/binaries/[gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf].
The [.specificText]#path to your downloaded toolchain has to be short#
e.g., [.inlineCode]#C:/toolchain# for Windows.
. Start CMake-gui, choose the 4diac FORTE source code folder and build
binaries, e.g. [.folderLocation]#forte/bin/raspberrySPS# and press the
configure button. A new window will be opened. As generator, choose
[.specificText]#Unix Makefiles# and check the [.specificText]#Specify
options for cross compiling# radio button.

. Configure the cross compiling options as it is illustrated within the
following image and press the [.button4diac]#finish# button.

toolchain for Raspberry-SPS]
. Choose posix as [.specificText]#FORTE_ARCHITECHTURE# and check
[.specificText]#FORTE_MODULE_Raspberry-SPS# as well as other desired
modules.
. Press the [.button4diac]#Configure# button until nothing remains red.
Afterwards press the [.button4diac]#Generate# button.
. The desired make files have been generated. Execute make within a
console and find the 4diac FORTE executable in
[.folderLocation]#forte/bin/raspberrySPS/src#
+
$ cd forte/bin/raspberrySPS $ make
. Copy the 4diac FORTE executable to the Raspberry-SPS and start
4diac FORTE with:
+
$ ./forte
