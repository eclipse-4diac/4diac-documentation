== Setting up Cygwin

=== Install Cygwin

In Windows, Cygwin provides the necessary tools and libraries for
building and debugging. Download Cygwin http://cygwin.com/[here]. During
installation, consider that there should not be any blanks in the folder
names of the installation. Follow the instructions of the installation
wizard and choose at least the following packages:

* binutils
* make
* gcc
* gdb

=== Set Environment Variables

After installing, you need to edit the PATH variable. You can access the
System Control Center by pressing [.button4diac]#Windows Key + Pause#.
In the System window, click [.button4diac]#Advanced System Settings →
Advanced (tab) → Environment Variables#. For Windows 10, a quick access
is to enter "Edit the system environment variables" in the Start Search
of Windows and click the button "Environment Variables". Change the PATH
variable (double-click on it or Select and [.button4diac]#Edit#), and
add the path where your Cywgwin is, e.g.
[.folderLocation]#C:\cygwin\bin#.

environment variables]

=== Test Cygwin

Open the command prompt of Windows either via the Program Menu or type
cmd in the Start Search of Windows. Enter [.inlineCode]#bash#. If the
bash prompt appears as shown in the picture below, it was successful. To
end Cygwin enter [.inlineCode]#exit#, then enter [.inlineCode]#exit#
again to end the command prompt.

=== Next steps

Now that you successfully installed a compiler, you can continue with
the next step of the
link:../../html/installation/install.html#FORTEsteps[installation
tutorial]. All information in the installation tutorial is based on a
setup with MinGW. As you are using Cygwin, you need to keep in mind the
following:

* When generating files for compiling in CMake, the tool "Unix
Makefiles" has to be selected. (Same tool as for the MinGW setup.)
* [.specificText]#The architecture option needs to be set in CMake: The
correct FORTE_ARCHITECTURE is Posix#
* When compiling, open Cygwin and go to the folder, where CMake built
the binaries. Execute the command make to compile.

cd FORTE_FOLDER_ROOT/bin/[YOUR_SYSTEM] make
