== External Event SIFB

External Events are events in 4diac FORTE, which are hidden and can not
be seen in 4diac IDE. They do not appear as red event lines. They are
usually used for Communication between Hardware and Function Blocks.
E.g. [.element4diac]#E_CYCLE# is a Function Block that uses this
functionality. It registers to the [.element4diac]#CTimerHandler# Class
to get External Events in a periodic time.

=== Recieving External Events

This is an advanced example showing how to make your own timed
T-Flip-Flop Service Interface Function Block. It is based on the
[.element4diac]#E_CYCLE# Block and works quite the same way. This
tutorial shows you how to build it from scratch. Consider that this is
just an example that does not follow the IEC 61499 standard.

==== The Interface

T Flip-Flop as SIFB with integrated Timer.

interface to 4diac FORTE] (*.h and *.cpp files) and
link:../../html/installation/install.html#externalModules[include them
to your build].

==== Edit the Headerfile

This time we want to create a timed [.element4diac]#SIFB# so we do not
inherit from [.element4diac]#CFunctionBlock#. Instead we inherit from
[.element4diac]#CEventSourceFB#. A [.element4diac]#CEventSourceFB# can
react to External Events. Therefore you should correct the first line of
your class declaration like this:

class FORTE_SIFB_T_FF3 : public CEventSourceFB\{

In this case we want to get External Events from the included Timer
handler. Include the 2 files [.fileLocation]#timerha.h# and
[.fileLocation]#resource.h# and change [.fileLocation]#funcbloc.h# to
[.fileLocation]#esfb.h#. Your include parameters should look like this:

#include <timerha.h> //added #include <resource.h> //added #include
<esfb.h> //instead of #include <funcbloc.h> #include <forte_time.h>
#include <forte_bool.h>

Then we need a new Constuctor as well as two new private members
[.specificText]#bool m_bActive;# which will indicate that the timed
Function Block is currently active and [.specificText]#STimedFBListEntry
m_stTimeListEntry;# which represents the Timer list entry of this timed
Function Block.

EVENT_SOURCE_FUNCTION_BLOCK_CTOR(FORTE_SIFB_T_FF3)\{
m_stEventSourceEventEntry.m_poFB = this;
setEventChainExecutor(pa_poSrcRes->getResourceEventExecution());
m_bActive = false; m_stTimeListEntry.m_stTimeOut.m_nLowerValue = 0;
m_stTimeListEntry.m_stTimeOut.m_nUpperValue = 0;
m_stTimeListEntry.m_nInterval = 0; m_stTimeListEntry.m_pstNext = 0;
m_stTimeListEntry.m_poTimedFB = this; m_stTimeListEntry.m_eType =
e_Periodic; };

Remove the default constructor [.specificText]#FUNCTION_BLOCK_CTOR# and
replace it with above. This consturctor registers this Function Block as
a External Event Listener, that triggers this Function Block if an event
occurs. Then the timer list entry is configured.

==== Edit the Sourcefile

Then you need to edit the [.specificText]#executeEvent# method. The
usual start and stop Events will register this block to the
[.specificText]#CTimerHandler#. Add a new event
[.specificText]#cg_nExternalEventID#, which is defined in
[.specificText]#CEventSourceFB#, and let it set your outputs. This will
be triggered if your Function Block receives an External Event.

void FORTE_SIFB_T_FF3::executeEvent(TEventID paEIID,
CEventChainExecutionThread *const paECET)\{ switch(paEIID)\{ case
cg_nExternalEventID: Q() = !Q(); sendOutputEvent(scm_nEventEOID,
paECET); break; case scm_nEventSTOPID: if(m_bActive)\{
CTimerHandler::sm_poFORTETimer->unregisterTimedFB(this); m_bActive =
false; } break; case scm_nEventSTARTID: if(!m_bActive)\{
CTimerHandler::sm_poFORTETimer->registerTimedFB(&m_stTimeListEntry,
DT()); m_bActive = true; } break; default: break; } }

Compile 4diac FORTE and run it. Test your new Function Block with the
tester. If something went wrong, compare your code with the following
files.

=== Sending External Events

To send External Events your Class must inherit from
[.specificText]#CExternalEventHandler#. In the Constructor you must
register this class:

m_nExtEvHandID =
sm_poDeviceExecution->registerExternalEventHandler(this);

Then you can send External Events with:

if(sm_poDeviceExecution->extEvHandlerIsAllowed(m_nExtEvHandID))\{
sm_poDeviceExecution->startNewEventChain(pointerToTargetFB); }
