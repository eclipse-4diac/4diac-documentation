== Updating the Target Platform used by 4diac IDE

The target platform defines the dependencies of 4diac IDE to other
eclipse projects. Currently the 4diac IDE requires the following:

* https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.xx
** Eclipse Java Development Tools, org.eclipse.jdt.feature.group
** Eclipse Platform SDK, org.eclipse.platform.sdk
** Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment,
org.eclipse.pde.feature.group
* https://download.eclipse.org/releases/20xx-xx
** EMF - Eclipse Modeling Framework SDK,
org.eclipse.emf.sdk.feature.group
** GEF (MVC) SDK, org.eclipse.gef.sdk.feature.group
** Git integration for Eclipse, org.eclipse.egit.feature.group
** OCL classic SDK: Ecore/UML Parsers, Evaluator, Edit,
org.eclipse.ocl.all.sdk.feature.group
** Xtext Complete SDK, org.eclipse.xtext.sdk.feature.group
* https://download.eclipse.org/elk/updates/releases/0.x.x
** Eclipse LayoutKernel (Incubation) - Core Components,
org.eclipse.elk.feature.feature.group
** Eclipse LayoutKernel (Incubation) - Layout Algorithms,
org.eclipse.elk.algorithms.feature.feature.group
* {blank}

For upgrading to new Eclipse platform versions the following steps need
to be done:

* Update org.eclipse.fordiac.ide.product.target in the
org.eclipse.fordiac.ide.product plug-in
* Update pom.xml in the 4diac IDE's source root directory. At least the
following steps have to be done:
** Check tycho.version
** Update tycho-repo.url to the new target platform version
** Check org.eclipse.equinox.executable version range. Attention this
has to be done on two places in the file. +
For the version check the latest
https://download.eclipse.org/oomph/archive/reports/download.eclipse.org/releases/index.html[release
overview page]. There check for _Eclipse Platform Launcher Executables_.
* Regenerate all model and model edit code from the models plug-in.
* Run product from Eclipse IDE using product editor, i.e., press the
synchronize button and then the "Launch an Eclipse Application"
* Run Maven install for pom.xml in the 4diac IDE's source root directory
locally
* Test if the generated product can be executed. The generated products
are in: +
/org.eclipse.4diac.ide/plugins/org.eclipse.fordiac.ide.product/target/products/org.eclipse.fordiac.ide.product
* Push to Gerrit so that CI build can also check if it is working
