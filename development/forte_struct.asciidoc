== Structured Datatypes

FORTE provides support for structured datatypes [.specificText]#STRUCT#.
Thus the encapsulation of data, which belongs together, is possible and
the engineering is facilitated. Currently [.specificText]#STRUCT#
datatypes have to be implemented in 4diac FORTE, since there are no
export-filters. Based on the
http://www.holobloc.com/doc/ita/s3.htm#3.4.5.1[Compliance Profile for
Feasibility Studies] only the unique ASN1-tag of the STRUCT-datatype is
used for encoding. Therefore the ASN1-tag has to be set to the same
value on all devices that exchange STRUCT-datatypes over the network!
For testing and documentation purposes a sample datatype is provided:

image:../../html/development/img/struct.png[Example STRUCT]

The definition file [.fileLocation]#TestStruct.dtp# is included in 4diac
LIB. The according implementation [.fileLocation]#FORTE_TestStruct.cpp#
and [.fileLocation]#FORTE_TestStruct.h# is provided in the module test
of 4diac FORTE.

Caution: the ASN1-tag provided in the dtp-file has to match the typeID
provided in the constructor of the implementation of the datatype.

<ASN1Tag Class="APPLICATION" Number="1" />

leads to

typeID=(e_APPLICATION+e_CONSTRUCTED+1)
