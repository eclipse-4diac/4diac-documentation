=== Layered Network Interface

The network interface is designed to be as flexible as possible. This
means that the integration of new protocols should be easy to implement
and that the reuse of implemented protocols is kept as high as possible.
The basis for the network interface is the implementation of the layer
design pattern. Every layer takes the role of one of the OSI-layers. The
interface between every layer is defined for all layers. Thus, it is
basically allowed to implement more or less layers from the OSI-layer
model.

An overview of the network interface is shown in figure 1. The figure
shows the different class types and the basic interaction of those. The
function block class (CCommFB) is the only class which interacts with
IEC 61499 applications, and has to be able to send and receive IEC 61499
events. The function block class and the layer classes are interacting
by the following functions, a detailed description is given in the this
section:

* openConnection: Called by the function block to open a connection, has
to be implemented by every layer and by the network stack.
* closeConnection: Called by the function block to close a connection,
has to be implemented by every layer and by the network stack.
* sendData: Called by the function block to send a message over the
network, has to be implemented by every layer and by the network stack.
* recvData: Called when new messages are received from the network, has
to be implemented by every layer.
* processInterrupt: Called from the network stack when a layer needs to
process data.

==== Configuration of Function Blocks

There are a lot of options how to implement an ID. A very convenient way
to specify the protocol, is used in the URLs of web pages: a web browser
uses the first part of the URL to identify the protocol, for example
http:// or ftp://. To be able to specify more protocols, a more flexible
way to specify protocols is needed. The following specification allows
to specify all layers of the OSI-model.

* [.inlineTitle]#protocol#: string to identify the protocol
* [.inlineTitle]#parameter:# vendor specific string
* [.inlineTitle]#ID:# \{protocol[parameter].}protocol[parameter]

The following example uses this specification to describe a connection
with an ASN.1 encoding and an TCP connection as transport layer:

fbdk[].ip[192.168.20.1:61499]

The naming of the layers is specified in the comlayersmanager.cpp file
which will be generated accordingly to the settings in CMake.

[[networkLayer]]
==== Network Layer

One network layer takes the role of one OSI layer. As there is no
information which layer will be implemented, a generic interface has
been chosen for all layers. The generic interface only defines basic
functions: open connection, close connection, send data, receive data
and generic interrupts. The functions are discussed in detail in the
following sections. There are also three roles a layer can take: top
layer, middle layer and bottom layer.

* [.inlineTitle]#Top Layer#: The top layer is able to access the data
ports of a function block directly and the send function is only used to
indicate that all data ports are ready to be sent.
* [.inlineTitle]#Middle Layer#: For the middle layer, all functions
defined in the generic interface must be implemented. In most cases the
middle layer adds some extra information to a message, like an encoding,
compression, session information etcetera.
* [.inlineTitle]#Bottom Layer#: The bottom layer is able to directly
access the network. The bottom layer also has to be able to get data
asynchronously from the network. The bottom layer will, in most cases,
not implement recvData function, as this is handled directly by the
network interface.

Overview of the Network Layer]

[[openConnection]]
===== Open Connection

The layer function openConnection is used to initialize the current
layer. The layer gets two types of information, first the parameter for
the initialization and a second parameter to create the bottom layer. A
layer does not know anything about the layer beneath it, therefore a
factory class has to create the beneath layer. The beneath layer is
created with the second parameter of the openConnection function, if
this is 0 no more layers below will be created. The openConnection
function is called when the function block receives an INIT+ event. The
function can also fail, for example, when the network device is not
ready.

connection successful]

image::../../html/development/img/OpenConnectionFailed.png[Figure 3:
Open connection failed]

[[closeConnection]]
===== Close Connection

The closeConnection function is dependant to the openConnection
function. The function closes all beneath layers and then closes the own
connection.

diagram of closing a connection]

[[sendData]]
===== Send Data

This function can be implemented in three ways, as top, middle or bottom
layer. The basic functionality of the function is to get data from the
above layer, pack it and send it to the beneath layer. The middle layer
is the most flexible layer, as it is possible to add additional middle
layers to almost every stack.

* The implementation of the top layer only differs, by whom and how the
function is called. A top layer is called from the function block and
has to get the information directly from the function block.
* The bottom layer has to write the data to the network. Therefore, the
sendData function will not call another sendData function like on the
top or middle layer. In most cases, the data is sent by the operating
system, by calling an API function of the operating system.
* The message is passed from one layer to the next until the last layer
is reached. The last layer (bottom layer), sends the message to the
network and returns a confirm event to the function block.

image::../../html/development/img/SendData.png[Figure 5: Send data on an
established connection]

[[receiveData]]
===== Receive Data

The recvData function is split into the same parts as the sendData
function. The top and middle layer are similar to the sendData function,
only the bottom layer needs additional discussion.

The problem of the bottom layer is that the system has to generate an
interrupt. A message from the network can be detected by an interrupt,
polling or a system call which waits until new data is received. The
execution thread of the function block cannot be used because that
thread is used to execute the function blocks. If the function block
thread was used, function blocks would not be executed while waiting for
an event from the network.

To solve this, 4diac FORTE implements an External Event Handler in
charge of processing external interrupts and starting the event chain
execution threads.

An interrupt based receiving of data is shown in figure 6. First of all,
the network triggers an interrupt at the External Event Handler. This
communicates the event to the bottom layer and starts an execution event
chain. The bottom layer then invokes the function block thread by
calling interruptCommFB(..). Once the Function Block receives the
External Event it will call the processInterrupt function of the network
layer. Process interrupt will be usually done at the bottom or middle
layer depending on how the data is processed. Afterwards, the
recvData(..) function will be called from lower to upper layer until the
FunctionBlock receives the data and emits the CNF+/IND+ signal

image::../../html/development/img/RecvData.png[Figure 6: Receive data of
an established connection]

[[genericInterrupt]]
===== Generic Interrupt

Receiving data is a special case of a generic interrupt. The generic
interrupt can also be used to receive errors of the network, like a lost
connection. In the same way as in the example of receiving data, the
external event handler informs the bottom network layer which invokes
the function block interrupt (or in some cases an intermediate layer)
and starts the event chain. Then, after receiving the External Event
signal, the function block sends the processInterrupt() to the network
layer, which returns an INIT- event indicating a lost connection.

[[functionBlocks]]
==== Function Blocks

The implementation of the function blocks is based on the compliance
profile. It is kept simple, the only implementation is the right
handling of input/output events and the instantiation of function blocks
with variable data input/output count. The event handling is described
in this section. This is the part which interacts directly with the
network interface.

Even though the event names of the function blocks are not the same, the
network interface only supports two forms of events: initialization
events and request events. The events can be refined in two aspects:
input/output events, and as successful/not successful.

Events received/sent by a network function block.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|Event name |I/O names |Direction |Description
|Init Positive |INIT+ |Input |Open new connection

|Init Negative |INIT- |Input |Close connection, or connection terminated

|Request Positive |REQ+/RSP+ |Input |Send data

|Request Negative |REQ-/RSP- |Input |Ignore value

|Init Positive |INITO+ |Output |New connection established

|Init Negative |INITO- |Output |Connection closed

|Confirm Positive |CNF+/IND+ |Output |New data available

|Confirm Negative |CNF-/IND- |Output |Received data is invalid or
connection error without connection closed
|===

===== Events to the Network Interface

The event direction, from the function block to the network interface is
a simple function call. The Init Positive event leads to a
openConnection call, the Init Negative event leads to a closeConnection
call. The Request Positive call is either used to allow new receive
events, if used in a server or subscriber, or to submit a send call, if
used in a client or publisher. The Request Negative event is not
handled, because it indicates invalid data at the function block input
port.

===== Events of the Network Interface

There are two events which triggers the network interface: in response
to an input event or asynchronously triggered by the network interface.

In most cases an input event leads to a corresponding output event, for
example, an Init Positive input event will trigger an Init Positive
output event as soon as the connection is established. To simplify the
generation of events, all functions described in section
link:#networkLayer[Network Layer] are able to return an event with a
corresponding status message. The currently supported events are listed
in link:#event_from_network[table]. The return events are prioritized,
because it is possible that one layer returns a positive, but the
underneath layer returns a negative send events: in this case, the worst
case returned. It is also possible to not return any event. This is
used, if the network interface does not trigger any event.

Events returned by a layer function call, ordered ascending by priority:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Event |Symbol |Description
|No Event |e_Nothing |No event is triggered

|Init Positive |e_InitOk |Connection established

|Process Data Positive |e_ProcessDataOk |Data processed successfully

|Init Invalid ID |e_InitInvalidId |Invalid ID while opening connection

|Init Terminated |e_InitTerminated |Connection closed.

|Invalid Object |e_ProcessDataInvalidObject |Data processing failure due
to invalid object

|Data Type Error |e_ProcessDataDataTypeError |Data processing failure
due to data type error

|Data Inhibited |e_ProcessDataInhibited |Trying to send data without
permission

|Socket Error |e_ProcessDataNoSocket |Data processing failure due to
missing Socket

|Data Send Failed |e_ProcessDataSendFailed |Data was not send correctly

|Data Receive Failed |e_ProcessDataRecvFailed |Data was not received
correctly
|===

The second way to generate an output event is an event, asynchronously
triggered by the network interface. This issue is covered by the
interrupt design pattern, described in link:#receiveData[Receive Data].
An asynchronous event can be triggered in two cases, if data was
received or a network error happened. The output event is triggered when
the stackProcess function is finished.

==== Network Stack

The network stack describes a container of layers, which is used by the
function block to send messages to the network. It is basically the
interface of the function block, which sends to the network interface.
For the network layers, the stack is the interface for accessing the
function block and its resources. The network stack is responsible for
the acquisition of the function block thread and the correct execution
of the interrupt routines.

At the moment, the network stack is used for these described functions.
The network stack is also used for feature extension, if a layers needs
to manage resources. A possible feature is a memory management unit,
where all layers request memory from a single pool. This brings a
refined control of the memory usage per network stack.

==== Layer Factory

It is not possible to instantiate a generic stack without the
configuration by the engineer, because this would mean the loss of
flexibility. Therefore the stack must be built at runtime. This means,
that it is not known, which layers are instantiated. The generic design
pattern to solve such a situation is a factory.

The factory does not only create a new layer, it also initializes it.
The above layer is informed by the new layer beneath it and the new
layer is initialized with the parameter string and the corresponding
network stack. This layer structure is a tree-pattern. Every layer only
has one layer above, but it can have more than one layer beneath it.

[[classesAndMethods]]
==== Classes and methods:

===== CComLayersManager:

Creates new connections requested by the FB and implements the factory
design pattern.

====== Methods:

* [.inlineTitle]#static CComLayer* createCommunicationLayer(char
*paLayerIdentifier, CComLayer* paUpperLayer, CCommFB * paComFB)#:
Creates a network Layer. Parameter paLayerIdentifier is used to create
all underneath layers, paUpperLayer is used to send data to the above
layer, and paComFB is the responsible Function Block.

===== CComLayer:

This class implements one layer of the network stack. In most cases this
class packs or unpacks data into a bigger frame. The last layer accesses
the network. In the last layer the recvData function is not used.

====== Methods:

* [.inlineTitle]#EComResponse openConnection(char *paConnectionParams,
char *paRemainingConnectionID)#: This function will configure this layer
and if necessary create necessary bottom layers.. The paConnectionParams
is used to configure the implemented layer, and paRemainingConnectionID
ids configuration data of layers below this one. If 0 or
*paRemainingConnectionID equals '0x00' than there is no further layer
below this one. Returns status of the opening process (e_InitOk).
* [.inlineTitle]#virtual void closeConnection() = 0#: Virtual function.
Implementations of this function should preform the actions necessary
for closing the layer and then call the closeConnection() of the bottom
layer.
* [.inlineTitle]#virtual EComResponse sendData(void *paData, unsigned
int paSize) = 0#: Virtual function. Takes the given data and performs
the necessary process for sending data.Parameter paData is the pointer
to the data to be sent and paSize is the size of the data. It returns
the status of the sending process.
* [.inlineTitle]#virtual EComResponse recvData(const void *paData,
unsigned int paSize) = 0#:Virtual function. Takes the given data and
performs the necessary process for receiving data. Parameter paData is
the pointer to the data received and paSize is the size of the data
received. It returns the status of the receiving process.
* [.inlineTitle]#virtual EComResponse processInterrupt()#: Virtual
function. Used to finish the data received in a context outside the
communication interrupt.

===== CCommFB:

This class is the function block, which uses the network stack for
sending and receiving data. The function block has to be able to start a
new event chain, otherwise it is not possible to switch between the
interrupt thread and the execution thread of the resource. We only show
a few of the methods here, for more information check source code

====== Methods:

* [.inlineTitle]#void interruptCommFB(CComLayer *paComLayer)#: Starts a
new event chain. This function is used to change the thread from the
interruptCommFB() call to the thread which executes the resource in
which the function block is created.
* [.inlineTitle]#getFBTypeId(void)#: This method is used by the Query
command to get the instances correct type name (eg. "CLIENT_3_2")
* [.inlineTitle]#EComServiceType getComServiceType()#: Returns if the FB
is of Publisher, Subscriber, Server or Client type.
